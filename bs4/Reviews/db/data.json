It's an interesting situation really, and an interesting game, it's not black or white here at all here, and it's interesting to have this title.The only reason I ended up willing to \"not recommend\" it is because I think there is some important feedback already, and I \"would not even recommend it to my friends for now\", which is truly surprising for a Dune game. I am considering not recommending to send this feedback, but also I am considering not refunding, and continuing to play and \"support the game differently\". I think it's the middle ground I can feel safe with at the moment.This means they can deserve my money, but maybe not \"a recommendation to my friends\" right now.I am a hardcore fan of everything Dune: I am even rewatching the extended, fan-edited version of Dune 1984, and replayed a large bit of all four Dune video games recently. Spice Wars is actually a polished experience, and I would dare say a good game even, but I expected not to be in a \"mixed\" situation about this. It could still sort this out, especially if it ends up being moddable. (moddability was mentioned as a possibility)It is really tough to recommend Dune Spice Wars and it's not because of EA.(+)The game is really neat and polished, on this part the studio always does an amazing job. Congratulations to them for this polished work. UI and camera are nice, however they do not help a big lot on the level of micro.(+)The multiple events and landsraad system makes me think it could use some moddability, and that would help the game immensely. (and I would remove my non recommendation in that case)(-)The game lacks some of the trademarks of previous Dune titles, and I don't speak here of the RTS-combat-style (that part is obvious and they have a right to try something different) but for instance it lacks the awesome soundtrack we had in Dune 1/2 or even 2000. There is a soundtrack but more absent and with less identity. Even the factions lack some identity because of how they are summarized and the components they share with each other.I would have liked more identity in troops among factions.I will test it further to check that. Maybe other factions have other soundtracks as well.(-)It also does not have the same \"story\" shared at the moment, but this part may evolve at release!All that does not make the entire game I guess, because I feel this title has more potential in multiplayer.(+)The rest is closer to Sins of a Solar Empire or Hegemony III Clash of the ancients, in terms of \"strategic engine\", multiple cities (planets in Sins), decisions etc. I liked how neat was Sins engine, I find some of it here.(-)The game has a lot of micromanagement vs risks , which is closer to Northgard in my experience (when you have to fight mercenary raids, you have some micro in Northgard).I did not appreciate the quantity of realtime micro in Northgard to be honest, especially because combat lacked detail but still needed a lot of micro so I did not know what exactly was my \"player input\" or what I was here for, considering my military details was weak and my economical input was rather generic. I have some of this here. I put that into being \"a newbie\" in Northgard and maybe it's so in Spice Wars.(++)The most \"dune\" aspect Spice Wars has, and it succeeds at this really well, is the feeling that there is a lot of space, dunes, and risks to being in the desert. The supply system works really well with that, and the sandworm adds to this nicely. Of course, the graphics are nice as well to represent this.(-)What I feel was \"extra micromanagement\" is more because of the multiple mini-events that require attention, and the difference of momentum between picking a technology now, choosing a building, \"oh but I need to go there now that's an emergency\", etc. This means you'll use active pause all the time and still hardly feel \"in control\" when 3 of your 4 ornithopters disappeared without a warning and for reasons unknown.It is also hard at the moment to feel in control of all the resources and outcomes but that's because it needs more game time to feel it.Right now I feel I have already seen what the game engine is about, the kind of contents we play with and the level of micromanagement (and active pause) we have. I have also seen the atmosphere/immersion and music quality.As mentioned, Spice Wars music is actually good, but far from the level of excellency we had in previous Dunes imo.The game has a hard time beating Dune 1 or 2 in immersion and the cartoony art style does not help here. For now I feel this game is \"under\" Dune 1 & 2 first impressions and I am sad about it.I would be thinking about not recommending this, but on the other hand, the developer is really clean and adding several factions later could still be interesting. I am torn.Really, I am not satisified by picking recommended, or not recommended. So you can consider it a \"mixed opinion, but I have some interest in this game and looking at how it will evolve\".For these reasons, I am sending this feedback - so that other players can decide for themselves - and am still keeping the game, in case it evolves in directions I would find great."}, {"username": "Illumanist", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I played Dune 2, Dune 2000, Emperor battle for Dune and after 30 years I got pretty bored of the adrenaline rush of building a base as fast as you can and zerging the enemy with barely any need for complex strategy other than just have more units and a lot of devastators lol. Games would sometimes be over before you even finished ya coffee. I needed something a little more diverse, something to stimulate more parts of my brain that grew tired of a genre which repeated its self for so many years.I spammed the ♥♥♥♥ out of Northgard and realized that I loved this fresh new pace. Instead of doing things as fast as you can like an asian on crack, you can ease into the game, slowly scout out areas of interest, seek which towns are more important to take for your resource gain etc. I love that I have to think about managing multiple resources instead of build a refinery and let the harvester mine spice and ill just spam units until the cows come home.  There are real consequences to miss managing your economy. If you try to use brute force, you may be punished if you can't keep that army supplied - Even worse when you don't pay your imperial spice taxes. I had all my resources in the green, had a well built army, only to have lost the whole crew to a sand worm that I didn't see coming. That set me back HUGELY. In dune 2000, a worm comes eats a unit, cool story bro ill just build another 20 in 5 seconds. As the game goes on, in the 2nd hour it just ramps up and gets more difficult and intense to manage depending on how well you did in the first hour, what towns you took, what buildings you built and where you placed your points in. if you slip up, you will pay greatly. The skill is in learning how to manage every aspect of your empire from beginning to end. On top of that, you have your enemy empires, pulling shiftiness on you through espionage and political gain which adds more heat to the frying pan. When they begin to bleed you dry of resources then send strong experienced troops to your borders, you are in trouble. I tell ya, if you can't handle this kind of heat, stay out of the kitchen and go back to pump and dump. As much as I loved that style of game play, I find this much more alluring as I've gotten older. It seems like because of the many aspects to winning and influence the systems have on this game, each game will be unique.Everything has weight, and depth, and complexity, yet not to a point where it is waayy to much information and my brain is completely overwhelmed like in TOTAL WAR or something. There are multiple ways to win rather than just SPAM LE ZERG. I love the new parts of my brain this is working. If you suffer from ADHD don't play it, you'll probably get so bored that you'll write a review 20 minutes after playing a single game to tell us all you don't like it and that it's boring without even having experienced it. I love the potential here, and I love this fresh new feel of a strategy game this is.  With community feedback, I feel this game is only going to get better.I like that you have to fend off raiders every now and then, but homies, add in the Sardukar that appear randomly and do some serious damage to your empire,  A couple more destructive environmental weather scenarios and possibly some more KEY points to take over which influence resources and unit production or unique weapons or shields or even HERO units, where instead of say Duncan Idaho being a Councillor and used as a passive bonus, he is a unit that you can use  on the battlefield. A couple of changes and further developments to this solid game and in my opinion we got a banger. Good Job, Shiro, Keep the spice flowing.Lastly, Multiplayer is going to be the real cream of the crop. I look forward to it eagerly."}, {"username": "Axonn", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "tl;dr:- My first impression was: OH MY, I'm PLAYING the BOOK!!!- The developers have \"implemented\" the book into a game in a very faithful way. And I even agree with Liet as a woman in order to balance things a bit!- I think the balance between RTS and 4X is done very well and the game is incredibly fun!- Fans of Westwood games will be disappointed, because this game is so much more than just \"pile tanks and throw them at the enemy\".- 5 hours later, it's 4 AM, I'm fried and have to go to bed. But I still needed to post these few words.- I'm almost sorry this is \"Early Access\" because this version is so awesome in its raw beauty. That being said, if this is \"Early Access\" then I can barely imagine what the future holds :).- NO BUGS for the ENTIRE DURATION of a full play session (5 hours long map). I repeat. NO. BUGS. Full version:An RTS where the actions you do behind the scenes influence the environment, the performance of your units and of the enemies. I don't have any problem with the combat being relatively simple for now: that's not the point, and whoever comes here for \"StarCraft on Dune\" will be sorely disappointed. The game shows AMAZING depth for an Early Access. I'm a veteran gamer and after crunching at it for 5 hours I still feel I'm barely half-way through what there is to offer here. I feel enormous replay potential here, simply by changing espionage and research tactics. I found the UI and UX very easy to understand. Got the hang of it rather quickly. The tutorial is simple and to the point. Amazing job on communicating a \"Dune\" feeling. The sound design is also very polished, snappy, futuristic, everything I expected it to be.The only few things I'd improve: randomize time a worm spends on a spice field and nerf rebellions. It's kind of outrageous to be able to insta-click a village into a rebellion. At least the opposing player should have a chance to counter that. Instead, the rebellion should show up as an event in which the opposing player has a way to counter it in 7 days or something like that.If I were to sum this game up in a single praising word, that word would be: ELEGANT. This is an elegant game, done in a stylish way. In a world full of brutish action, obsessed with DPS, clicks-per-minute and rabid action, this game is like ballet."}, {"username": "meestaShin", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Hmm....As a person who loved the Dune games of the past, I'm like 70/30 with this. 70% negative, 30 positive. I went and bought this game blind, so that I can be surprised by every element of the game. I know it's early access, but there is not a lot going on in the game. It's like a mixture of Civilization and any RTS game. If they are intending to add vehicles and flying units later on, I feel like they should've done that before releasing the early access.If you're looking to experience things from the old Dune games, this is not it. I feel like they made it more complicating than it has to be. Too many different currencies, no vehicles, and it gets repetitive, really fast. You just run back and forth with soldier type units. You can trade with factions that you're  attacking, which I found to be weird. Every area around you will attack at random, so I'm not sure why treaties are even a thing. They should've chosen either Civ style completely or RTS because I love both genres, and it just doesn't mesh well here."}, {"username": "Charlie", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Wasnt very impressed, i guess im old but I was hoping for a classic RTS that reminded me of the old Dune game.

The game does not feel like the Dune universe, does not have the same serious adult feel,,, its more like civ cartooney animation that has become so prevalent throughout the industry, If you are a 4x fan it offer's little in the way of innovation and the game failed to surprise me so far. Overall the game brings nothing new to the table and is a little dull,, if the title did not say Dune it could be any other random 4x clone"}, {"username": "bakermoose", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "I know this is early access but the game just didn't do it for me.  There is just so much lacking from the game that sure could be added later, but the game systems are flawed, which means whatever they add is still being put on a wobbly table.  ProsIt's Dune.  Great atmosphere, great feel.  Love the graphical style of the game.  It's simple.  Early game and learning is quite fun.Con'sAfter you get through the early game everything slows down and I'm a guy who loves games like civ on marathon.  The problem here is everything is slow, and repetitive and tedious for no reason.Too many currencies are needed for building and upkeep.  It is really punishing for any sort of expansionist ideal.  Also the currencies are so inter-connected that your always struggling to keep them going.Only 5 unit types really.  No armour, no flying machines.  Scouts that are useless once the map is explored.  And good luck trying to get any number of units because that ain't happening, which means that if you do expand, you're constantly moving units, very slowly, back and forth to defend from the indigenous raids or attacks.  Well defended towns aren't worth attacking because as soon as you do, reinforcements come and another faction is attacking you across the map and you have no units to fight them.  So you build defence buildings.  But then you have too much upkeep and no resource attainment to keep it all going.Its just repetitive, boring/not fun and my god worms aren't even a worry.It will take alot to make this game good, overhaul it."}, {"username": "Appery", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "As of 2022-04-27: The voice actors for the Fremen units repeatedly mispronounce proper nouns in the Dune universe's lexicon. I wouldn't normally be bothered by this, but the mispronunciations aren't even internally consistent. There's \"Shaley-Hulud\" and \"Shaw-Hulud\" from the same voice and it's very confusing. This, along with \"Air-uh-kiss belongs to the Fremensss\" is uttered on a very regular basis and it kind of pulls me out of the immersion. This is the nerdiest, most specific thing I will ever leave in a review.Other than the above, this is a really great addition to the long history of adaptions of Dune. Some of it might not be very intuitive if you've never played a Real Time Strategy or 4X style game before, or if you aren't familiar with some Dune lore, but the game eases you in with not-too-many tutorial tooltips.Multiplayer isn't released yet, but I'm eagerly anticipating it to play a few rounds with friends.As with a lot of these games, it's hard to know where to focus to succeed. I think the 'quest' system where you get some short term objectives and a reward (or to stave off a penalty) is really cool, but I missed a few of them because the UI element was small and far away from the other notifications.There are a couple of 'missing' keyboard shortcuts. I'd really like to iterate through the list of each village I control because micromanaging the buildings in each is important.I haven't finished my first round on all default game settings yet, so I'm actually not 100% on what all the win conditions are.

I know I saw this a lot but it is so true for those of us that want to give an honest review and don't feel right giving  a game an outright Yes or No review but would like to give a early  thoughts on a game, even more so when it is at the price point that Dune: Spice Wars released at into Early Access.I am a huge fan of Dune.  I have read all of the Frank Herbert books multiple times since I was a teenager and Dune first came out.  I even have read the majority of his son's continuation along with Kevin J. Anderson up until the Caladean Trilogy which I haven't ever gotten around to.   I know I will take heat for saying it but I even like the Lynch Movie, parts of the SyFy Miniseries and really like the 2021 Villeneue film.    I played the early 90s Dune games, and the late 90s Emperor: Battle of Dune Strategy Game.   So bottom line is I am a big fan of Dune.   So it pains me to play just under an hour of Spice Wars and try to figure out other than using House names, some of the technology like Ornitophers, Freman, Arkasis, Spice, and the various Houses what the game honestly has to do with Dune other than borrow bits and pieces of Dune IP here and there.   Maybe a future campaign will pull it together but at this point as much as I am a fan boy I think it is too far into Early Access for me to trust that the game is going to be what I had hoped it would be.   As far as a straight up RTS.  There really isn't anything majorly wrong with it.  But I just don't really feel like I am playing a Dune RTS with four factions all flying Orintophers all over and occasionally a Spice Worm poking it's head up.   I hate to be a negative Nancy on this one but in lieu of there not being a <meh> button I am going to give it a No for recommend at the moment.    If you are just looking for a new RTS to play and have $30 to burn then maybe it will be for you.   But if you are hoping on spending $30 (at least now) to get a real Dune RTS experience then you may want to wait.  I am sure the price may rise, and if they change things up I will come back and buy it if it ends up looking like it becomes what I am hoping but for now I am going to go on the side of caution and refund this on because $40 is high price to pay on an EA game just because it's based on an I.P. that so far looks like it is not really being used in a way that , at least I, would like to see it used."}, {"username": ".exe", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Lite on RTS, alot more strategic.

MGH brings the BRAND NEW definition of 4v4 Asymmetrical horror game where there are actually plenty of things to do. Coordination, teamwork, utilising correct weapons, checking the environment, adapting perks to the environment to keep your game going, outsmarting your opponents when they least expect, mind games and what not!Now judging those similar games: If you are coming from Propnight then this game will offer you EVEN more. MGH has advanced version of props where you can switch to almost any props depending on their size and power. You can just hide in it or aim a trajectory to knock or kill Hunters. That's really satisfying where Propnight indefinitely fails to offer. Switch to small props for quick mobility or bigger props for aggressive gameplay. If you are coming from DBD, then you will have a new experience where you need to adapt with 3 extra hunters (total 4). While MGH is based on perk system but it's perks are not yet wide as dbd. But devs will keep adding perks as the time goes.If you have been a legacy Evolve/Evolve Stage 2 player (2013), then this game is for you as well. It's REALLY like 'Kill the Monster before it Kills you'. As a hunter if you fail to kill all ghosts before midnight strikes, then these ghosts become powerful thus posing great threat to hunters. Before that ghosts need to hide and play hide n seek game to avoid destruction. Team play is a must thing here. Ghosts even damage the generator like the Stage 3 monster in Evolve used to do to win the game. Remarkable!!!MGH also blends with Rainbow Six where you need to select your gadgets and utility gears tactfully. As a hunter, be advised to check what your team is loaded with and that's where you will decide your own game.Best thing about MGH is devs are hearing well to the community. And the most GRAND thing is, unlike DBD where they keep saying \"Pretty good job so far\" yet so unbalanced, MGH is balanced where devs have pledged to keep the game BALANCED at any cost. You won't be disappointed with the balance unless your opponents are really OP or your team is bad.Only disappointment this game has is 'Matchmaking'. As a new player with Level 0 chances are there you will come across players with even Level 70. They end the game real quick. Best advice you host your own game for a while to get players of same skill sets and get accustomed till you feel ready to join others' servers and do some damage. Devs are fixing on this issue as well.Also you can't complain much since this is in early access and it really has been wonderful to play so far.There's nothing much to grind here, things will be alright with you as the time goes by.And about toxicity? If you're reading this then you are already a Evolved MMO or a veteran 4v1 player where you have learned to deal with everything ;).

Of course there's going to be some anomalies where some things just feel op, but I have yet to see any circumstance where I felt like it was completely unfair. Matchmaking is a bit iffy, but I never ever got shredded immediately by the opposing team if they were higher levels. The game is a pretty fun experience either way. As ghosts, you can fight back or hide, and either way works tbh. You don't necessarily have to fight back early as ghosts at the beginning, but you could (In my experience, I usually just end up dying alongside some of my teammates). The wide arrangement of abilities, weapons, perks and other stuff is very nice. The graphics and sounds are very nice too. tl;dr, In my experience of the game so far (mostly in public lobbies), its a fun game. Not really any toxicity. Community is actually pretty great from what I've seen. Hunters and Ghosts feel balanced in my opinion.

Original prop hunt on Garry's Mod takes away health, so you had to be strategic about your shots.

It's an interesting situation really, and an interesting game, it's not black or white here at all here, and it's interesting to have this title.The only reason I ended up willing to \"not recommend\" it is because I think there is some important feedback already, and I \"would not even recommend it to my friends for now\", which is truly surprising for a Dune game. I am considering not recommending to send this feedback, but also I am considering not refunding, and continuing to play and \"support the game differently\". I think it's the middle ground I can feel safe with at the moment.This means they can deserve my money, but maybe not \"a recommendation to my friends\" right now.I am a hardcore fan of everything Dune: I am even rewatching the extended, fan-edited version of Dune 1984, and replayed a large bit of all four Dune video games recently. Spice Wars is actually a polished experience, and I would dare say a good game even, but I expected not to be in a \"mixed\" situation about this. It could still sort this out, especially if it ends up being moddable. (moddability was mentioned as a possibility)It is really tough to recommend Dune Spice Wars and it's not because of EA.(+)The game is really neat and polished, on this part the studio always does an amazing job. Congratulations to them for this polished work. UI and camera are nice, however they do not help a big lot on the level of micro.(+)The multiple events and landsraad system makes me think it could use some moddability, and that would help the game immensely. (and I would remove my non recommendation in that case)(-)The game lacks some of the trademarks of previous Dune titles, and I don't speak here of the RTS-combat-style (that part is obvious and they have a right to try something different) but for instance it lacks the awesome soundtrack we had in Dune 1/2 or even 2000. There is a soundtrack but more absent and with less identity. Even the factions lack some identity because of how they are summarized and the components they share with each other.I would have liked more identity in troops among factions.I will test it further to check that. Maybe other factions have other soundtracks as well.(-)It also does not have the same \"story\" shared at the moment, but this part may evolve at release!All that does not make the entire game I guess, because I feel this title has more potential in multiplayer.(+)The rest is closer to Sins of a Solar Empire or Hegemony III Clash of the ancients, in terms of \"strategic engine\", multiple cities (planets in Sins), decisions etc. I liked how neat was Sins engine, I find some of it here.(-)The game has a lot of micromanagement vs risks , which is closer to Northgard in my experience (when you have to fight mercenary raids, you have some micro in Northgard).I did not appreciate the quantity of realtime micro in Northgard to be honest, especially because combat lacked detail but still needed a lot of micro so I did not know what exactly was my \"player input\" or what I was here for, considering my military details was weak and my economical input was rather generic. I have some of this here. I put that into being \"a newbie\" in Northgard and maybe it's so in Spice Wars.(++)The most \"dune\" aspect Spice Wars has, and it succeeds at this really well, is the feeling that there is a lot of space, dunes, and risks to being in the desert. The supply system works really well with that, and the sandworm adds to this nicely. Of course, the graphics are nice as well to represent this.(-)What I feel was \"extra micromanagement\" is more because of the multiple mini-events that require attention, and the difference of momentum between picking a technology now, choosing a building, \"oh but I need to go there now that's an emergency\", etc. This means you'll use active pause all the time and still hardly feel \"in control\" when 3 of your 4 ornithopters disappeared without a warning and for reasons unknown.It is also hard at the moment to feel in control of all the resources and outcomes but that's because it needs more game time to feel it.Right now I feel I have already seen what the game engine is about, the kind of contents we play with and the level of micromanagement (and active pause) we have. I have also seen the atmosphere/immersion and music quality.As mentioned, Spice Wars music is actually good, but far from the level of excellency we had in previous Dunes imo.The game has a hard time beating Dune 1 or 2 in immersion and the cartoony art style does not help here. For now I feel this game is \"under\" Dune 1 & 2 first impressions and I am sad about it.I would be thinking about not recommending this, but on the other hand, the developer is really clean and adding several factions later could still be interesting. I am torn.Really, I am not satisified by picking recommended, or not recommended. So you can consider it a \"mixed opinion, but I have some interest in this game and looking at how it will evolve\".For these reasons, I am sending this feedback - so that other players can decide for themselves - and am still keeping the game, in case it evolves in directions I would find great."}, {"username": "Illumanist", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I played Dune 2, Dune 2000, Emperor battle for Dune and after 30 years I got pretty bored of the adrenaline rush of building a base as fast as you can and zerging the enemy with barely any need for complex strategy other than just have more units and a lot of devastators lol. Games would sometimes be over before you even finished ya coffee. I needed something a little more diverse, something to stimulate more parts of my brain that grew tired of a genre which repeated its self for so many years.I spammed the ♥♥♥♥ out of Northgard and realized that I loved this fresh new pace. Instead of doing things as fast as you can like an asian on crack, you can ease into the game, slowly scout out areas of interest, seek which towns are more important to take for your resource gain etc. I love that I have to think about managing multiple resources instead of build a refinery and let the harvester mine spice and ill just spam units until the cows come home.  There are real consequences to miss managing your economy. If you try to use brute force, you may be punished if you can't keep that army supplied - Even worse when you don't pay your imperial spice taxes. I had all my resources in the green, had a well built army, only to have lost the whole crew to a sand worm that I didn't see coming. That set me back HUGELY. In dune 2000, a worm comes eats a unit, cool story bro ill just build another 20 in 5 seconds. As the game goes on, in the 2nd hour it just ramps up and gets more difficult and intense to manage depending on how well you did in the first hour, what towns you took, what buildings you built and where you placed your points in. if you slip up, you will pay greatly. The skill is in learning how to manage every aspect of your empire from beginning to end. On top of that, you have your enemy empires, pulling shiftiness on you through espionage and political gain which adds more heat to the frying pan. When they begin to bleed you dry of resources then send strong experienced troops to your borders, you are in trouble. I tell ya, if you can't handle this kind of heat, stay out of the kitchen and go back to pump and dump. As much as I loved that style of game play, I find this much more alluring as I've gotten older. It seems like because of the many aspects to winning and influence the systems have on this game, each game will be unique.Everything has weight, and depth, and complexity, yet not to a point where it is waayy to much information and my brain is completely overwhelmed like in TOTAL WAR or something. There are multiple ways to win rather than just SPAM LE ZERG. I love the new parts of my brain this is working. If you suffer from ADHD don't play it, you'll probably get so bored that you'll write a review 20 minutes after playing a single game to tell us all you don't like it and that it's boring without even having experienced it. I love the potential here, and I love this fresh new feel of a strategy game this is.  With community feedback, I feel this game is only going to get better.I like that you have to fend off raiders every now and then, but homies, add in the Sardukar that appear randomly and do some serious damage to your empire,  A couple more destructive environmental weather scenarios and possibly some more KEY points to take over which influence resources and unit production or unique weapons or shields or even HERO units, where instead of say Duncan Idaho being a Councillor and used as a passive bonus, he is a unit that you can use  on the battlefield. A couple of changes and further developments to this solid game and in my opinion we got a banger. Good Job, Shiro, Keep the spice flowing.Lastly, Multiplayer is going to be the real cream of the crop.

And I even agree with Liet as a woman in order to balance things a bit!- I think the balance between RTS and 4X is done very well and the game is incredibly fun!- Fans of Westwood games will be disappointed, because this game is so much more than just \"pile tanks and throw them at the enemy\".- 5 hours later, it's 4 AM, I'm fried and have to go to bed. But I still needed to post these few words.- I'm almost sorry this is \"Early Access\" because this version is so awesome in its raw beauty. That being said, if this is \"Early Access\" then I can barely imagine what the future holds :).- NO BUGS for the ENTIRE DURATION of a full play session (5 hours long map). I repeat. NO. BUGS. Full version:An RTS where the actions you do behind the scenes influence the environment, the performance of your units and of the enemies. I don't have any problem with the combat being relatively simple for now: that's not the point, and whoever comes here for \"StarCraft on Dune\" will be sorely disappointed. The game shows AMAZING depth for an Early Access. I'm a veteran gamer and after crunching at it for 5 hours I still feel I'm barely half-way through what there is to offer here. I feel enormous replay potential here, simply by changing espionage and research tactics. I found the UI and UX very easy to understand. Got the hang of it rather quickly. The tutorial is simple and to the point. Amazing job on communicating a \"Dune\" feeling. The sound design is also very polished, snappy, futuristic, everything I expected it to be.The only few things I'd improve: randomize time a worm spends on a spice field and nerf rebellions. It's kind of outrageous to be able to insta-click a village into a rebellion. At least the opposing player should have a chance to counter that. Instead, the rebellion should show up as an event in which the opposing player has a way to counter it in 7 days or something like that.If I were to sum this game up in a single praising word, that word would be: ELEGANT. This is an elegant game, done in a stylish way.

I feel like they made it more complicating than it has to be. Too many different currencies, no vehicles, and it gets repetitive, really fast. You just run back and forth with soldier type units. You can trade with factions that you're  attacking, which I found to be weird. Every area around you will attack at random, so I'm not sure why treaties are even a thing.

There is just so much lacking from the game that sure could be added later, but the game systems are flawed, which means whatever they add is still being put on a wobbly table.  ProsIt's Dune.  Great atmosphere, great feel.  Love the graphical style of the game.  It's simple.  Early game and learning is quite fun.Con'sAfter you get through the early game everything slows down and I'm a guy who loves games like civ on marathon.  The problem here is everything is slow, and repetitive and tedious for no reason.Too many currencies are needed for building and upkeep.  It is really punishing for any sort of expansionist ideal.  Also the currencies are so inter-connected that your always struggling to keep them going.Only 5 unit types really.  No armour, no flying machines.  Scouts that are useless once the map is explored.  And good luck trying to get any number of units because that ain't happening, which means that if you do expand, you're constantly moving units, very slowly, back and forth to defend from the indigenous raids or attacks.  Well defended towns aren't worth attacking because as soon as you do, reinforcements come and another faction is attacking you across the map and you have no units to fight them.  So you build defence buildings.  But then you have too much upkeep and no resource attainment to keep it all going.Its just repetitive, boring/not fun and my god worms aren't even a worry.It will take alot to make this game good, overhaul it."}, {"username": "Appery", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "As of 2022-04-27: The voice actors for the Fremen units repeatedly mispronounce proper nouns in the Dune universe's lexicon. I wouldn't normally be bothered by this, but the mispronunciations aren't even internally consistent. There's \"Shaley-Hulud\" and \"Shaw-Hulud\" from the same voice and it's very confusing. This, along with \"Air-uh-kiss belongs to the Fremensss\" is uttered on a very regular basis and it kind of pulls me out of the immersion. This is the nerdiest, most specific thing I will ever leave in a review.Other than the above, this is a really great addition to the long history of adaptions of Dune. Some of it might not be very intuitive if you've never played a Real Time Strategy or 4X style game before, or if you aren't familiar with some Dune lore, but the game eases you in with not-too-many tutorial tooltips.Multiplayer isn't released yet, but I'm eagerly anticipating it to play a few rounds with friends.As with a lot of these games, it's hard to know where to focus to succeed. I think the 'quest' system where you get some short term objectives and a reward (or to stave off a penalty) is really cool, but I missed a few of them because the UI element was small and far away from the other notifications.There are a couple of 'missing' keyboard shortcuts. I'd really like to iterate through the list of each village I control because micromanaging the buildings in each is important.I haven't finished my first round on all default game settings yet, so I'm actually not 100% on what all the win conditions are.

I have read all of the Frank Herbert books multiple times since I was a teenager and Dune first came out.  I even have read the majority of his son's continuation along with Kevin J. Anderson up until the Caladean Trilogy which I haven't ever gotten around to.   I know I will take heat for saying it but I even like the Lynch Movie, parts of the SyFy Miniseries and really like the 2021 Villeneue film.    I played the early 90s Dune games, and the late 90s Emperor: Battle of Dune Strategy Game.   So bottom line is I am a big fan of Dune.   So it pains me to play just under an hour of Spice Wars and try to figure out other than using House names, some of the technology like Ornitophers, Freman, Arkasis, Spice, and the various Houses what the game honestly has to do with Dune other than borrow bits and pieces of Dune IP here and there.   Maybe a future campaign will pull it together but at this point as much as I am a fan boy I think it is too far into Early Access for me to trust that the game is going to be what I had hoped it would be.   As far as a straight up RTS.  There really isn't anything majorly wrong with it.  But I just don't really feel like I am playing a Dune RTS with four factions all flying Orintophers all over and occasionally a Spice Worm poking it's head up.   I hate to be a negative Nancy on this one but in lieu of there not being a <meh> button I am going to give it a No for recommend at the moment.    If you are just looking for a new RTS to play and have $30 to burn then maybe it will be for you.   But if you are hoping on spending $30 (at least now) to get a real Dune RTS experience then you may want to wait.  I am sure the price may rise, and if they change things up I will come back and buy it if it ends up looking like it becomes what I am hoping but for now I am going to go on the side of caution and refund this on because $40 is high price to pay on an EA game just because it's based on an I.P. that so far looks like it is not really being used in a way that , at least I, would like to see it used."}, {"username": ".exe", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Lite on RTS, alot more strategic.

A unique title that takes inspiration from games like Zoo Tycoon 2 (ZT2) , Jurassic Park Operation Genesis (JPOG), and Planet Zoo (PZ), while attempting to improve on the mechanics of each.Construction:Right now, despite just launching into EA, you can already make stunning parks through the use of modular pieces, similar to PZ, but with the added flexibility of 3-axis object scaling. Like PZ, you can place plants individually or, if you want to, you can go full-blown ZT2 style and paint forests. Unlike ZT2 though, you can decide what types of plants are placed while painting, giving you lots of control over foliage creation while also providing a much more streamlined experience than games like PZ. Moreover, the plants painted using the brush still function as modular pieces that you can individually select. Keep in mind though, it still an early access title, so there are bugs here and there, but it's already a blast to create exhibits and shops in PK.Animals:Since the game is still in early access, the animal behavior is lacking. However, what does exist is already quite good. Thanks to the animations, animals feel alive despite not having much under the hood ai-wise. Small little animations like preening or yawning give the animals a lot of character, and the well implement inverse-kinematics reduce clipping and make the creatures feel grounded. Sometimes you'll notice a bit of jankiness in the movements, or perhaps a few visual glitches, but this is to be expected for an early access title, and the bugs are comparable to ones that exist in PZ.All in all, if you enjoy park builders like ZT2, JWE2, or PZ you'll probably get quite the kick out of PK, and with a fleshed out road-map (with features such as breeding, expanded social behavior, and food production planned in the next year) things are looking bright for this game and its dev team.#PKSWEEP"}, {"username": "Frederick Freaker", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "While definitely an Early Access game still under development, Prehistoric Kingdom has continuously shown great promise.

And so does Prehistoric Kingdom, a title I’ve kept a close eye since 2017 back when it was first announced on Kickstarter. Five years later, the time has finally come to experience this prehistoric wildlife simulation which was conceived one year prior to Jurassic World Evolution, yet is now forced to remain in its shadow at least temporarily. PK’s in Early Access, of course. Properly labeled as such, it’s got a very long road ahead. Blue Meridian (formerly known as Shadow Raven Studios) were hard at work on their debut project which was successfully funded on Kickstarter since early 2018. With the help of Crytivo as their publisher, Prehistoric Kingdom can finally grace us with its presence on Steam. JWE finally has a worthy competitor. The more, the merrier for dinosaur fans.Story Unlike the conventional zoo portrayal, the niche dedicated to prehistoric animals has laid dormant for extended periods of time, not just in terms of PC games, but also for motion pictures. I’m a child of the early 90s, of course I fondly remember Spielberg’s forays into the dinosaur lost worlds. In gaming, I enjoyed  Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs. An expansion pack from 2002 which introduced me to this particular subgenre of established economic sims revolving around genetic manipulation and subsequent revival of species which went extinct long before humanity’s determined path towards evolution. From the current title I’m reviewing, only mammoths and saber-tooth cats were still alive during the Ice Age that archaic humans also witnessed. Dinosaurs didn't coexist with our ancestors.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800497237 There are several elements of fantasy at play here. Suspension of disbelief is required. From theory to practice we still have more than a few steps until we can successfully revive / clone even mammoths from the most preserved DNA samples carved straight out of the Siberian permafrost. Actual dinosaur cloning is a pipe dream still kept alive by paleontologists and geneticists alike. Brushing ethics aside, there are still numerous risks involving such activities. As Jurassic Park (1993) so eloquently puts it through Jeff Goldblum's character: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.” Prehistoric Kingdom had the inspiration to include a respectable naturalist and wildlife conservationist such as Nigel Marven as the game’s narrator and voice of reason in the Tutorial I strongly suggest you try out before any other game modes. At the time of this writing, there are no other scenarios available for the Early Access, though I suspect Nigel’s involvement shall be long term for this project. A more fleshed out campaign with a story across multiple chapters and maps, will be most welcome at a later date. Especially if it involves more prebuilt structures and exhibits that can facilitate and even encourage creativity in the more casual player base. More on that in the gameplay section.Graphics The first cracks in the façade appear in the form of performance issues, quite uncharacteristic for a game that’s being powered by the Unity Engine. PK’s a sight to behold, of that much there can only be a general consensus. The technical price you’re paying for the eye candy may be rather steep though. We’re talking of very poor frame rate in spite of fiddling  with the graphical settings. Shadows appear to be the most taxing on the system, but you won’t see a much smoother experience even if you disable them entirely. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800497195Something must be done in this regard by the dev team, lest the game’s performance shall become an Achilles’ heel undermining the otherwise spotless attention to detail and customization above and beyond Prehistoric Kingdom’s direct competitors. There’s both a Photo Mode and the option to disable the game’s HUD with the press of a button. Screenshot enthusiasts can rejoice. Especially if they’ll soon be able to run this title in manner not resembling a slideshow.AudioNigel Marven lends his voice for narration and instructions, while the wildlife sounds are also simulated very convincingly. I had no qualms with what I heard in-game. The soundtrack is discreet, but it didn’t become repetitive or annoying at any point. More voice acting for random visitors and future missions, please.GameplayImagine how appalled I was to discover in the rebooted “Zoo Tycoon: Ultimate Animal Collection” features already built and seemingly set in stone such exhibits and paths, forcing players to quite literally follow a dotted line in terms of game progression. Prehistoric Kingdom does the opposite, though I wouldn’t call it an extreme or even unpleasant. The “carte blanche” approach here means that you’re given a free hand in how you’ll construct, supervise and customize your prehistoric park. No pre-built paths and relatively few prefabricated structures. You must let your creative spirit run free, while taking your time with those exhibits in which overlapped scenery won’t be an issue. It’s as seemless as the terraforming tools that are akin to painting a fresh canvas. You can create as much as you want within the paused time flow. Hopefully Steam Workshop support shall be implemented alongside user generated maps and assets.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800497077Speaking of your most important assets, those extinct reptiles and mammals are given a lot of attention. Before you can clone and splice their genetic sequences into new subspecies, you must gain access to excavation sites worldwide. That’s a form of natural gameplay  progression, as both funds and science points are needed when unlocking new park attractions. Visitor interaction is limited for now, as are staff capabilities, though I have to applaud the developer’s decision in regards to “waste management”. Making full usage of dung beetle nests sure beats the age old concept of minimum wage employees having to shovel all that dinosaur “bowel movement residue”. It’s the small things which keep adding up. Just like the exhibit appeal which is tied to the critters’ satisfaction. Happy dinosaurs result in more guests and funds.VerdictI’m certain that it’s only a matter of time until new maps and scenarios shall breathe further life into Prehistoric Kingdom’s true potential. On the first order of business, the performance issues must be addressed ASAP. It won’t matter how beautiful your project might be, if only a minority with high-end systems can enjoy it, while mid-range and low-end machines struggle. PK shall remain a PC exclusive in the foreseeable future, so it better focus on making it a very pleasant experience, on top of its massive educational value transcending mere entertainment. Browse the in-game encyclopedia, it’s fully worth it. I can only say the same about the Early Access price of admission. Extinction is not an option. Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics & sounds.+ Complex economic simulation.+ Replay value through customization.Weak Points- Severe performance issues, abnormal for a Unity project.- Current lack of scenarios or proper story / campaign.- No Steam Achievements nor Trading Cards.This article was submitted for Imperial Reviews.

Things will hopefully improve from here.The short of it: I don't recommend the game in the current state. - The performance is atrocious. I got a 2070 SUPER, 16GB DDR4, and i7-9700. Not top of the line by any means but enough to nail 60-144fps high/ultra 1440p in every game I play whether it's new top end AAA games or little indie titles. This game struggles to hit 50fps on low settings at 1080p. Unacceptable performance, even for early access. - No interactions. The animals lay down, roar, and eat. They don't do anything else. This is more acceptable given the early access 0.1.0 point of the game, but disappointing none-the-less. It's not fun to watch the dinosaurs for more than a couple minutes because of this.- The guests do nothing. They don't view the habitats. They don't interact with the binoculars, they don't climb the viewing platforms. They do nothing but walk around aimlessly while money magically generates around them.- The pathing is barebones. You place a path on the ground for the guests to walk around aimlessly on. No smooth griding, no connections to shops. Just blanket ground placements that do the absolute minimum.- No employees. No zoo keepers, security, vets, janitors, etc. Pretty self explanatory. Just nothing to manage.- Exactly the last thing. There's no management. Excavate dinos, incubate a few, place them in fenced area, repeat. There are some good things too, like the item scaling and foliage brushes, but they're not enough to outweigh the problems and lack of content. I know this is early access so some of these things are excusable day 1, but there was a bare minimum I was expecting. Enough to actually play the game for a few hours. It's just not there right now. Maybe in a few months, or a year, it'll be worth picking up but for now I just don't recommend it."}, {"username": "typical. 🎃", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Despite being early access there's a huge number of beautifully made prehistoric species (not just dinosaurs!) some incredibly flexible building controls, and some of the best terrain tools in a zoo-style game to boot.

It's humor and zany cutscenes have devolved since the older games, but the tradeoff is a complete rework including redone levels, an excellent combat system and an expansive galaxy that has a decently immersive effect.First, the Story: The story does a more accurate job of retelling the saga with tons of decent voiceacting (you can turn off voice acting with mumble mode to have an older LEGO experience. I will say though, mumble mode isn't single mumbles, they mumble out entire sentences, so it feels a little weird), the cutscenes work with or without voiceacting which is a surreal dynamic experience that the devs get my kudos on, but the levels themselves are really short and kind've disappointing. They introduce \"level challenges\", there are 3 in every level and they're alternative ways of going about each one. They're fun in general, but if you're trying to 100% they can be a nightmare sometimes. Minikits have been reduced from 10 to 5 per level, which was debatably my favorite part about replaying a level. Overall, cutscene and immersion-wise, the levels are fun to play and have the same great puzzle-solving they've always had, replayability is quite low though.First-Time through 9/10Free-Play 100% 6/10 (basically, thank god they're short)Now Galaxy-Mode was easily the most fun I've had through the whole experience. Instead of collecting gold bricks to a grand total of 250, (using the Marvel Avengers game as the mold here since it's the last one I 100%'d, god it sucked), there are 1,160 bricks, (known as \"kyber bricks\") that are collectable through completing level challenges, collecting minikits, getting \"true jedi\" on each level, doing side quests among 33 planets, destroying kyber comets, smuggling, doing bounty hunts, and puzzles on each and every planet. It was a ton of fun to mark each planet off the list as I collected each planets' worth. Some quests can only be done if you've progressed through the story up until that point, or until you've done other side quests. Personally, I recommend playing the base game all the way through 4-6, 1-3, 7-9, THEN doing galaxy-mode, so there will be less holdups. In advance, there was only 1 planet that gave me trouble and it was Endor, my guess is, the fire VFX would keep spawning as you laoded new areas, and it wouldn't unload areas your're not in anymore so the constant fire VFX made it a laggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Other than that, the quests and puzzles are really fun to complete.9/10, it is the after-story experience you want.I'll wrap it up here with the UI, combat/upgrade system, and the red bricks rework.So the Ui for the most part is pretty straightforward, might take a bit of learning but once you have it down, it all makes sense, stuff goes where it should go, changing characters is a bit messy and if you have OCD about how you want your free-play characters organized, that might be a huge problem because thats the only place where the UI falters heavily. Once you play, you'll figure out what I mean.The combat system is EXTREMELY intricate, you have a third person firing mode with guns and saber-throwing. There's also cover you can hide behind (and rebuild if it gets destroyed) and shoot from if you want to play that way. The biggest highlight though is the melee combat system. You initiate combat with a standard attack which can then go into changeups like heavy attacks, uppercut moves, and spike moves, depending on which corresponding button you press. These changeups become extremely prevalent in the lightsaber boss duels which make you feel like you control how the corresponding movie-scene flows.The red brick rework has been made easier to manage and deal with, you don't collect red bricks, instead you collect \"Data cards\" (1 per particular planet) in galaxy mode. They aren't specific to certain extras, you get the data card and choose which extra you want. (I recommend not buying anything until you get your first data card and do the stud multiplier route, things are hella expensive this time around so I'd say focus on getting all multipliers before you buy anything else) That being said \"Stud magnet\" and \"Fast build\" aren't extras anymore, they're \"Upgrades\"The upgrade system integrates things like collecting studs, building faster, sprinting quicker, having more health, doing more damage, etc. which is where kyber bricks come in, as they are used as it's currency, plus an additional stud fee. (Now this is the exception to my advice about \"not buying anything\", buy upgrades when you can) There are core upgrades and class upgrades for specific character types, (Jedi, Hero, Bounty Hunter, Scoundrel, Scavenger, Villain, Dark Side, Astromech Droids, Protocol Droids, and Extras.) all of which have their own abilities and uses.All of these features really make the experience flow a lot smoother and are a perfect 10/10 for me.TL;DR: buy the game if you've been wanting a decent Lego Star Wars game, things are different for the better, mumble mode is there, and if you get deluxe, you get classic character packs (if nostalgia is your thing) among other misc. character packs. red bricks have been changed into a more easily flowing system, and the combat = good.Big word of advice: once you're in galaxy mode, buy the rumor for the character \"Grummgar\", complete all the missions to get him and you get to run really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fast around some of these bigger planets to complete your side quests."}, {"username": "Koshō", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "As a veteran Lego Star Wars fan, I have mixed feelings.This game is great on a technical level, having all 9 of the movies in one package.

To some, that sounds like a good thing, but to me, it fails to make an impact on the player. Just when the level starts to get good, it ends.Also, the bugs. I have no idea how a LEGO game, has this many bugs. The mumble mode that so many LEGO veterans like me have been so excited for; it actually breaks some of the in-game sequences. In my experience, I also have quite a few game-breaking bugs that force a game reset, and even a crash to desktop.When I first booted this game up, I was beyond excited.

MGH brings the BRAND NEW definition of 4v4 Asymmetrical horror game where there are actually plenty of things to do. Coordination, teamwork, utilising correct weapons, checking the environment, adapting perks to the environment to keep your game going, outsmarting your opponents when they least expect, mind games and what not!Now judging those similar games: If you are coming from Propnight then this game will offer you EVEN more. MGH has advanced version of props where you can switch to almost any props depending on their size and power. You can just hide in it or aim a trajectory to knock or kill Hunters. That's really satisfying where Propnight indefinitely fails to offer. Switch to small props for quick mobility or bigger props for aggressive gameplay. If you are coming from DBD, then you will have a new experience where you need to adapt with 3 extra hunters (total 4). While MGH is based on perk system but it's perks are not yet wide as dbd. But devs will keep adding perks as the time goes.If you have been a legacy Evolve/Evolve Stage 2 player (2013), then this game is for you as well. It's REALLY like 'Kill the Monster before it Kills you'. As a hunter if you fail to kill all ghosts before midnight strikes, then these ghosts become powerful thus posing great threat to hunters. Before that ghosts need to hide and play hide n seek game to avoid destruction. Team play is a must thing here. Ghosts even damage the generator like the Stage 3 monster in Evolve used to do to win the game. Remarkable!!!MGH also blends with Rainbow Six where you need to select your gadgets and utility gears tactfully. As a hunter, be advised to check what your team is loaded with and that's where you will decide your own game.Best thing about MGH is devs are hearing well to the community. And the most GRAND thing is, unlike DBD where they keep saying \"Pretty good job so far\" yet so unbalanced, MGH is balanced where devs have pledged to keep the game BALANCED at any cost. You won't be disappointed with the balance unless your opponents are really OP or your team is bad.Only disappointment this game has is 'Matchmaking'. As a new player with Level 0 chances are there you will come across players with even Level 70. They end the game real quick. Best advice you host your own game for a while to get players of same skill sets and get accustomed till you feel ready to join others' servers and do some damage. Devs are fixing on this issue as well.Also you can't complain much since this is in early access and it really has been wonderful to play so far.There's nothing much to grind here, things will be alright with you as the time goes by.And about toxicity? If you're reading this then you are already a Evolved MMO or a veteran 4v1 player where you have learned to deal with everything ;).

Matchmaking is a bit iffy, but I never ever got shredded immediately by the opposing team if they were higher levels. The game is a pretty fun experience either way. As ghosts, you can fight back or hide, and either way works tbh. You don't necessarily have to fight back early as ghosts at the beginning, but you could (In my experience, I usually just end up dying alongside some of my teammates). The wide arrangement of abilities, weapons, perks and other stuff is very nice. The graphics and sounds are very nice too. tl;dr, In my experience of the game so far (mostly in public lobbies), its a fun game. Not really any toxicity.

I've played it for a little while, having picked it up when it first released as early access on steam and its development has been amazing to watch. With entirely new campaigns and massive boosts to the games performance, modding capabilities, and base game throughout.  DestructionOriginally I was drawn to it after hoping for something to rekindle that feeling of Red Faction: Guerrilla and other destruction focused games, Teardown more than delivered on that front. Pretty much everything can be destroyed in many different ways, structures can even catch fire, fire which then spreads in a realistic fashion, burning buildings down to the ground or making them a burnt out husk. It really is a game where a building with a locked door can be resolved in many ways: Breaking through a nearby window, using your blowtorch to burn out the lock, or just driving a piece of heavy construction machinery through the wall.  Story / plot In terms of story and plot, your character operates a small family run business that had previously been struggling to keep the lights on. Until one day you get an email to perform a somewhat \"unauthorised demolition\" from here things just grow larger, seeing you knocking down towers, stealing priceless art, causing petty vandalism against a wealthy car owner. Eventually you find yourself stealing military weapons, visiting tropical islands, uncovering dastardly plots, and you also get to fight killer robots!  Modding  It's safe to say that from my perspective, the game has a wonderful and vibrant modding community, with plenty of active modding support provided by the devs, and a decent API to work with. Modders have made things ranging from advanced weapons to destroy structures, functional portal guns, AC 130 airstrikes, massive amounts of high quality vehicles from movies and real life, entire custom levels  and even campaigns that involve high quality detailing and interaction for players to enjoy.  There have even been mods made that completely change the nature of the game, such as turning it into a fire fighter sim, a hack and slash shooter game, even old school games. In effect the modding allows people to turn the engine to make whatever they can think of.  The Devs  The devs simply have been amazing. Really friendly and active with the community on the games discord. Quite often you'll find the devs getting really engaged with whatever creations modders are coming up with, and having very good discussions with the community, clearly laying out plans and often delivering more than we could have hoped for in the community. This is one of those games that have been boosted by having such active and driven devs who genuinely care about the game.  Conclusion / Should I buy / TL:DR Teardown is a fantastic game filled with plenty of content to keep you busy. It more than is worth its initial cost and the content keeps growing from there. Personally I've found it to be exactly the game I had wanted for a long time but just hadn't seen delivered anywhere near as well as it has been here. 10/10 would recommend again."}, {"username": "pwnedgod", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "You like blocky games?You like destroying stuff?You like making shortcuts by blowing up buildings?You like abusing saves to achieve the perfect game?This is the game for you."}, {"username": "BadDorok749", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Everything goes \"BOOM\", including your own PC."}, {"username": "Embrace Ralsei", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Teardown development team:⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠋⠉⠈⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢏⣴⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⣾⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⢢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⠀⡴⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠶⢴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣁⡀⠀⠀⢰⢠⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⣴⣶⣿⡄⣿⣿⡋⠀⠀⠀⠎⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠗⢘⣿⣟⠛⠿⣼⣿⣿⠋⢀⡌⢰⣿⡿⢿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣧⢀⣼⣿⣿⣷⢻⠄⠘⠛⠋⠛⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣧⠈⠉⠙⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠈⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢃⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠴⢗⣠⣤⣴⡶⠶⠖⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡸⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⢠⣾⣿⠏⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠉⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠈⢹⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠈⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⡟⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠁⠀⠀⠹⣿⠃⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠉⠉⠁⠀⢻⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠈⣿⣿⡿⠉⠛⠛⠛⠉⠉⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⢀⣀⣠⡴⣸⣿⣇⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡿⠄⠙⠛⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⠄"}, {"username": "[NL] Imetysaw", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "With this game now launching in 1.0, I have to give it the due respect it deserves and give it a big thumbs up.When this game was first shown, I just thought \"looks like a cool tech demo, but that is all\".When it was then released in early access, I thought \"this is a seriously impressive piece of software, but I do not see it becoming an interesting game\".Now in it's current state, I will happily admit that I was completely wrong. The destruction is so satisfying, and all you wish for is more and more. During the campaign you often spend a large amount of time trying to plan stuff out, destroying things in a particular way, setting up planks and vehicles creatively such that you can get all the objectives done in time. When you then complete the level, it is super satisfying. Furthermore the campaign itself is also pretty interesting, with different types of level objectives available, with a nice background story to it all as well. The progression feels great too, with more tools of destruction becoming available to you over time.My utmost respect to the creators of Teardown.

For those who can survive it’s punishing and complicated gameplay and harsh world, it is without a doubt one of the finest games ever made, as well as the best game in the entire Elder Scrolls series.Releasing in September 1996, just 3 months after Quake, Daggerfall was a first person mouselook driven real time action RPG that was visually impressive for its time and larger than any game ever made before it. Daggerfall’s single CD-Rom contained comparatively few FMV cutscenes compared to many RPGs and adventure games of its era. Instead Bethesda developed a massive realistic game world. Unlike the prior game, Arena, Daggerfall had a persistent game world which was not randomly generated. The Iliac Bay of Daggerfall was larger than any other RPG even to this day. Towns were miles and miles of wilderness apart from one another, and you had no chance of finding any dungeon or quest location without having an NPC mark it on your map. Layered on top of this open world Bethesda presented most of The Elder Scrolls gameplay as it exists to this very day. With a few exceptions, every Elder Scrolls game since Daggerfall has only removed mechanics.So why is it not more well known? While Daggerfall’s gameplay is more modern than most DOS games, its default controls and interface are not. New players are greeted with cursor based mouse navigation common in many games released in the mid 90s on DOS, including the first Elder Scrolls game. The game is largely unplayable to modern players with this control scheme, as it is a fast paced modern 3D action game. Mouse look is 3 menus deep in the original release, and is a necessity, along with the smaller HUD. Much like Bethesda games to this very day, Daggerfall is an extremely rushed mess of bugs, undocumented gameplay, and bizarre default settings. These things sometimes add to the games charm, but often involve you not knowing you could improve or remap some control (you can, to an impressive degree for 1996), or falling through stairs into a void. Many players of Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim are simply immediately turned off by its dated DOS-only engine running at 320x240 and its old school design. For many years, this was the only option for playing Daggerfall. Modern players can install Daggerfall Unity, linked in many of the other reviews, for a better experience on modern operating systems and an active modding scene.Despite its age and comparative obscurity, Daggerfall remains the finest Elder Scrolls game yet made. Once learned, its combat is more solid and consistent than later games, while still containing the same dice rolls and stat based calls. Stats in general are way more balanced than in later games. No fortifying STR to 1000. Most systems from later games exist in some form, though many, like potion making are hard to find. Spellmaking and the general magic system is the most intricate and open in the series. You can make spells that do basically anything with multiple effects. Dungeons are almost too large and too intricate, Daggerfall released at the absolute tail end of the Dungeon Crawler era, and wears this on its sleave. Later games in the Elder Scrolls series contain worlds the size of Rhode Island with hundreds of citizens. Daggerfall presents a world two times the size of the UK with millions of citizens. Towns contain tens of blocks, not 3. All enemy races have a language skill that can be checked to potentially avoid combat. Most of the later lore, other than some specific Nordic, Alesian, and Dwemer stuff is fully fleshed out here in the games lore books, which are already here and serve the same function as later games. All the divines exist, and have joinable temples, and all major guilds present in the later games are represented here as well. The games story and lore contain plot revelations which effect the entire Elder Scrolls Series, and players who have only played the later games often make basic lore mistakes and misinterpret aspects of the stories of Morrowind and Skyrim because they do not know this game’s story. By the end of Daggerfall, you will know the true fate of Tiber Septim and his empire.Daggerfall is my favorite game. I played it for the first time in 2012 or so, so I am not guided by nostalgia. I recommend it to any RPG fan who can stomach its mechanics.

This is probably my favourite RPG ever, and I'll explain exactly why that is.Character CreationThis is always a point brought up when people mention Daggerfall, so it's nothing new to say that it has a ridiculously in-depth character creation system. This isn't complex due to aesthetical reasons akin to most modern RPGs, but complex due to mechanical reasons. You can make almost any kind of character you want (to varying degrees of difficulty).You wanna make a character who studied economics and archery in his early years, only to pick up exotic languages of creatures and medicinal training later on? That weirdness is possible, if you deem it so.Also yes, that's right; this game lets you 'speak' to enemies if you know their language. It's not well fleshed out, and more-so pacifies rather than actually opening dialogue, but it's a cool idea that was later fleshed out in Battlespire, a game I wish remained a DLC like originally planned due to that.For anyone familiar with tabletop RPGs, this game's character creation works similarly to that of GURPS, though more mathematical. You can pick advantages like being a great zombie hunter, or disadvantages like having a phobia of spiders; all of which modifies the time it takes for you to level up. You have a bunch of skills to choose from, and base attributes to distribute/roll points for.GameplayThe gameplay loop of Daggerfall is an interesting one. This game is less of a heroic fantasy and more of a fantasy life simulator. You can go around very large scale cities, strike up slightly odd conversations with the sprawling amount of civilians within, visit the bank, take out a loan, purchase a house, fail to pay it back, get chased by loan sharks, etc. It's insane how in-depth a game from 1996 can be. Of course these systems, though very much there, are simple at their core. Once you buy a house, you can't do much in it, just kind of exist there. A lot of these issues can be fixed with mods (as per usual with Bethesda games), so if you'd like to decorate things and whatnot I'd advise checking out Daggerfall Unity; a fan-made source port that modernises the game and supports a plethora of mods.Dungeon crawling is a big part of the game, and though it can stretch out to long extents, it's still a lot of fun. Pre-set dungeons exist but the majority are procedurally generated akin to a rogue-like of sorts, changing up the game every time you play. Puzzles, monsters and treasures galore. It's also very easy to get lost.Combat is fun, albeit it can be deadly (and if you know what you're doing, very broken). You swing swords for melee, different directions having different hit chance and damage ranges. Archery is here, and spellcasting is ridiculously in-depth. You can craft insanely complicated spells, and it's a lot of fun - and unlike Morrowind's equally great spellcrafting system, this one doesn't hold back at all; you have access to all spells to craft with right off the bat. Have fun.The WorldThe world is amazing, for it's time. The atmosphere is beautiful and despite the graphics, absolutely pulls you into the universe. This is mostly due to the wonderful music and audio, which is incredibly underrated; it's all dynamic, dependant on weather, reputation, location, etc. It can be terrifying, peaceful, mystical and fantastical. It's amazing. Different regions will have different cultural themes, different city layouts and ruins. The wilderness is empty, for the most part (something that can also be fixed with mods), but it is rarely a requirement for moving through, as fast travel is incredibly useful and simulative (real time will pass by as you travel, and you will have a bunch of different ways you can get from one place to the next, varying your speed).A final noteI'm not speaking through nostalgia goggles. This was the fourth Elder Scrolls game I'd played through, and it's still my favourite. It has it's quirks, it's certainly not without it's issues, but it's a ridiculously unique game, literally nothing else exists that plays similarly to it. If you can handle dated games, I highly advise checking it out. Play through Privateer's Hold and get to a city. Join a guild, and you'll be hooked. If you can't quite handle a dated game like this, I'd advise Daggerfall Unity (hell, I'd advise it to everyone, even the ones that can handle the dated original), it fixes bugs, adds advanced mod support, is easier to run on modern systems, has great built in options for ease of play (smaller dungeons, click to attack, etc.) and is just overall an amazing fan-made project. It's still in beta, I think, so there are still some bugs (less than the original though) and optimisation issues when it comes to mods, but it's playable from start to finish none-the-less.Daggerfall is dope.

I wouldn't be surprised if it gets an update within the next couple weeks to fix its issues.  This is the version of the game released for floppy disks, and some additional voice acting, improved sounds, and video cutscenes are missing from the CD release. Additional, the original copy protection has been left in the game, and one will have to consult a steam guide, wiki page, or find a pdf of the original manual to bypass it.  Something important to note is that Arena, like many other RPGs of its time, expected the player to read the manual before playing the game or after the first hour. Unfortunately, the manual has not been included.  TES Arena has a strong focus on dungeon crawling, which is done through a first person perspective. Arena is the most linear of The Elder Scrolls Games, and you'll be mainly going through hand crafted dungeons, rather than randomly generated ones like some later titles. Dungeons are completed one floor at a time, making them a bit more manageable than Daggerfall, though you'll have to make good use of the mapping mechanics. (Left click the map to add notes and right click the compass rose for moving the map view!) Dungeons are reset if you leave, so you'll typically want to wait until completing the dungeon before going back to town for getting new supplies. You'll also find riddles sprinkled throughout dungeons, giving a nice change in pace. Character creation is minimal compared to other TES games. Choose a race and cosmetic head; and choose or create a class for stats, equipment restrictions, and a few special abilities. While you can do side quests, most of them are randomly generated for very simple dungeons with random rewards. Daedric quests are available with special rewards, though are too random."}, {"username": "SHADOWELITE7", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "From what I remember there are 2 versions of TES: Arena Floppy Disk TES: Arena CD ROM TES: ArenaThe steam release is the Floppy Disk version of the game you can get on the Bethesda Website and previously the now defunct Bethesda Launcher. I have alot of hours playing the CD ROM version which is on GOG. The game is great but it will take awhile to learn and get used to the controls. One thing I realized is with the Floppy Disk version for the Steam release. It doesn't come with the game manual so you can know what you would need to know when playing the game. The game at the beginning is fairly old school as it doesn't tell you how to play. You have to use the manual to figure it out. Once you get used to the game. The game becomes really fun. I would recommend the GOG version over this. Hopefully in the near future, Bethesda could bring the CD ROM (GOG) version of Arena to steam as a possible update. Or possibly a remaster from NightDive. As for those who are trying out a DOS game for the first time and start noticing some low framerate. Go to the Steam directory of the game. In the file explorer search bar, type in .conf to access the dosbox configuration file. Change the 20000 cycles to something higher. I use 50000 cycles which makes the game on its high graphics setting run smoothly. one thing in particular, the CDROM version does contain voice acting for both cutscenes and certain npc's that will say something at you like, \"Stop Thief\". However, as Arena just released on steam. I wouldn't recommend the floppy disk version of the game but only the CDROM version. If you want to just try it out on steam because you don't have GOG. Go right ahead but I think you will like going to GOG to play its already better version of the game. PS: if you are an Elder scrolls fan.

The magicka absorption one is my favourite. It allows you to use enemy spells to fill your own magicka reserves, essentially allowing you to never run out of magicka at all.All of the enemy sounds are iconic. The wailing of the wraiths, the squeak of the rats, and that odd huff noise the spiders make... All will fill you with fear at one point or another. Well, maybe not the squeaks.. The rats are pretty harmless.The world map is intimidatingly huge and theoretically endless. Still, the main quest is easy to follow and I never found myself lost.

The first couple of hours were fairly fun, learning how to play and unlocking new items - but it quickly became repetitive. There just aren't enough interesting features to keep the gameplay fresh for a long time.You literally just buy things and then resell them for a markup. You can buy shirts and then sell them, or buy wool, craft them into shirts and sell them for a slightly higher profit. Crafting does not feel very special - it's just a click, and there's no way to experiment or learn new recipes, they automatically unlock by themselves. As soon as you unlock a new recipe, merchants will also begin selling that item so it doesn't feel like much of an achievement. The more you craft a certain recipe, the higher chance your item will turn out better quality, but merchants also sell great quality items. So you can work really hard to make a couple of extra gold profit, but it doesn't FEEL particularly cool. It also seems strange that there's a farming system that lets you automate most of the alchemy craft, and part of cooking, but no systems that interact with the other crafting trees. I feel like alchemy must be much more profitable than other crafting trees because you can constantly get free herbs by growing them. Gameplay during the day is a little strange - customers serve themselves as long as you have the item they want on display. But each display can only hold one of each item so you have to be restocking constantly, which you do by just pressing R on the shelf. So most of the game you spend just standing next to shelves spamming R. You can hire employees to restock for you, but it feels like a waste of money because it's very easy to run around pressing R, and if you have employees restocking for you then you pretty much just stand there doing nothing anyway. At the start of the game you are told that you need to pay back your family's debt, and have to pay a certain amount every 4-5 days or its game over. Other than that, there's no story to the game. There are no NPC events and you can't talk to anybody. There are some \"events\" that explain why some things become more expensive or why NPCs want certain types of items, but you don't really feel any impact. E.g. the game might tell you that your country is at war, so tools and metal are more in demand, but there's no backstory about why that's happening, and nothing changes to make you FEEL it, e.g. military NPCs come to the shop.The coolest part of the game is probably the shop building element. Expanding your shop is pretty intuitive and there's quite a lot of different furniture items to decorate your shop however you like. The problem is that it is very expensive to expand even just a few squares. I played on Hard mode for my first game and never had a problem paying off my debts each week. However even when I had to pay back 900 gold at the end of the week towards my debt, it would cost me 1100+ to expand my shop by 4-5 tiles. The debt ends up feeling like an annoying money sink that just prevents you from playing with the only fun mechanic in the game. In summary, after a couple of hours I ended up in an endless cycle of buying materials, crafting them and putting them on display. Over and over, then after a week or two I could expand the shop by a couple of squares. I wish there was more content, like NPCs with personalities, rare crafting items that only the player can make and can't be bought from merchants. Maybe you can hire other employees who can mine for you or hunt?

Where moonlighter focused (In my opinion too much) on the dungeoning, Winkeltje is through and through solely a shop builder.There are many different options for the type of shop to specialise into - from alchemy, to tool crafting, to cooking, and clothing. With an interesting system that tailors the customers you get to the types of items you sell - Sell lots of potions, and you'll get more requests for more advanced potions for example - but this system also only tracks the previous few days of sales, so if you want to switch focus then you can.The decoration and customisation in the shop itself is arguably one of its best strengths. Every furniture piece - as far as I can tell - sells for its buy price, so if you mess up a display and want to change it then you don't lose resources for doing so. I can't speak for the difficulty of dealing with the debt system and managing prices on the higher difficulties, but if you're looking for a shop management game which actually focuses entirely on managing the shop, with a minor focus on farming to get certain materials, then this is definitely the game for you."}, {"username": "IggyBoo", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "It's a fun game and progression is paced pretty well.

The employees are great to keep everything stocked on the shelves but you get lost with all the crafting and gardening required to really get those top profits. If I could Hire crafting employees as well and set production limits then I could focus on organizing flow and look of the shop and making sure I have enough stock. That should be the ultimate goal for the endgame, just set everything up and let your employees do the grind for you while you relax and manage them.HOWEVER ... up to that point I HIGHLY recommend this game if you are into this genre. It scratches the itches but the endgame needs a bit of ... ointment."}, {"username": "Koffy™", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "The game is mediocre at best.

I've only played for around 100 minutes as of writing and I am already in love. However it does need some re-balancing. Now to be fair, I wrote this on the day it came out, so obviously there are gonna be some balance issues. I'm just gonna list about things I noticed:Conquest Mode: This is the main mode of the game, where you invade sectors across 4 islands and conquer the enemy base at the end. It has a cool risk and reward system where the more sectors you invade, the more units and abilities you get, however the stronger the enemy becomes. The only thing I have to say about this game mode is that it needs difficulty descriptions for the sectors, as some battles will be harder than others and you can't really tell.Endless Mode: Pretty obvious here, you pick whatever units you want and survive as long as possible against an enemy that's getting more and more difficult as it progresses, I didn't really find many issues with it, but I wasn't really too interested either.Random Battle: This is honestly my favorite mode. you spawn with varied (i would say random but I think some units are always added no matter what for fairness) units and try and defeat the enemy AI. Its nice for trying out new units and is also nice as you don't have full control over your starting units. I think the AI do need to be updated, as each difficulty seems rather easy to beat no matter which you select.Balance issues:your regular standard grunt unit has a grenade launcher that can nearly insta-kill basic enemy units (I should note now this game has no multiplayer and some of the AI's units are different than yours) - To fix this, maybe make it a tier 1 upgrade, as to be fair, they only get 1 shot, they can miss it, and it is useful for enemy defenses and vehicles.you can spawn 3 support units, and I believe their buffs might stack, which is pretty unfair, plus they have an artillery attack and having 3 of them at once using it seems a lil unfair.you can spawn 3 snipers who will sit FAR from the enemy and just pick them off without destroying the enemy base. they do insta-kills on infantry so you could essentially just grind with them, or spawn a single unit and just push with them while the snipers cover, and the snipers get a HUGE range boost when you use the hold button, making them even more unfair - my idea for this is to just make it so you can only spawn one, they can only push a little forward, and are more defensive type unitsthe shield units can be spawned in 3s and are really useful when the enemy has a lot of infantry or snipers, but i think their health should be reduced some.you can spam turrets with enough funds in clustered groups.units don't need to recharge which means as soon as one dies, you can instantly spawn another, which is fine for weaker units, but is really unfair for your tougher units, plus some units have abilities to spawn more units that don't add to your unit limit/supply/whatever its called.other than that and some other issues I probably don't know about, the game is fun and is a good way to waste time, plus it has no micro transactions, which also a plus in my bookIdeas I have:More unitsmore mapsdifferent themed enemies (aesthetics mostly, but having different themed enemies with their own custom units would be cool as well)more unit customization, maybe different base designs or unit outfits, or anything along those lines.Different types of battles. This might need some explanation. I noticed that based on difficulty, the enemy will have a different base designs each time. I think these bases having their own abilities would be cool, for example, there is an enemy base that is basically a big friggen missile on the back of a truck. maybe you need to destroy the truck before time runs out, or maybe a base that has turrets and can defend itself. Stuff like that.TL;DR the game is fun and a good time waster. It needs some balance patches for cheesy strats against the AI, but other than that I recommend this game absolutelyPS: all the songs in this game are absolute bangersEdit:  Some clarity, the cheesy strats I was talking about were in random battles. The main gamemode is a lot different since you have finite units and abilities and can choose which units to bring into battles, while random battles give you obviously random units. I also didn't play the main gamemode on its hardest difficulty, which i definitely should have, so both of those errors are on me. I have now played on harder difficulties and can say that the game does have challenge. Sorry about that."}, {"username": "Savira", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Bought this on a whim because of the sale and it looked cute, and I gotta say, I really like the style this game is going for. I want to call it a \"lazy strategy\" in the best way possible. You can take as much time as necessary to prepare for your missions and plan them out, and even on the field, there's ample time to understand your next move at every step. Units seem to have clear counters and strengths, upgrade progression feels nice, it feels well balanced all around.One of my favourite things about Warpips so far is, I never feel like I have to think about too much at once. I can enjoy the chaos, without straining my brain to the point that I can no longer focus on anything aesthetic at all {looking at you, Starcraft}. The fact that there is very little micro-management in this game means the player is truly in more of a \"commander\" seat, rather than an all-controlling god. You just say what your army should look like, and when they should move, but they'll figure out the details themselves. Your main job tends to be appreciating the hilarious pixel-art mayhem that ensues after dropping hundreds of dollars on expensive war equipment.I would really just love to see more content for the game. More units, upgrades, abilities, maps and map types, multiplayer co-op and PvP, other game modes, almost anything honestly. I could see myself becoming addicted to this game for a long time if the devs continue to expand it and experiment.

Annoying as ♥♥♥♥.-Not much depth to the gameplay, it's all about clicking units as soon as they're available (There are some units that  counter certain other units, but most of the time you won't have them because, you guessed it, they expired the battle before.)-No PvP (Yet, hopefully)-Battles are repetitive, but not in a good roguelike way, as this game has no randomness(events/encounters) to justify it.For 4,80€ during sales?

I've played it for a little while, having picked it up when it first released as early access on steam and its development has been amazing to watch. With entirely new campaigns and massive boosts to the games performance, modding capabilities, and base game throughout.  DestructionOriginally I was drawn to it after hoping for something to rekindle that feeling of Red Faction: Guerrilla and other destruction focused games, Teardown more than delivered on that front. Pretty much everything can be destroyed in many different ways, structures can even catch fire, fire which then spreads in a realistic fashion, burning buildings down to the ground or making them a burnt out husk. It really is a game where a building with a locked door can be resolved in many ways: Breaking through a nearby window, using your blowtorch to burn out the lock, or just driving a piece of heavy construction machinery through the wall.  Story / plot In terms of story and plot, your character operates a small family run business that had previously been struggling to keep the lights on. Until one day you get an email to perform a somewhat \"unauthorised demolition\" from here things just grow larger, seeing you knocking down towers, stealing priceless art, causing petty vandalism against a wealthy car owner. Eventually you find yourself stealing military weapons, visiting tropical islands, uncovering dastardly plots, and you also get to fight killer robots!  Modding  It's safe to say that from my perspective, the game has a wonderful and vibrant modding community, with plenty of active modding support provided by the devs, and a decent API to work with. Modders have made things ranging from advanced weapons to destroy structures, functional portal guns, AC 130 airstrikes, massive amounts of high quality vehicles from movies and real life, entire custom levels  and even campaigns that involve high quality detailing and interaction for players to enjoy.  There have even been mods made that completely change the nature of the game, such as turning it into a fire fighter sim, a hack and slash shooter game, even old school games. In effect the modding allows people to turn the engine to make whatever they can think of.  The Devs  The devs simply have been amazing. Really friendly and active with the community on the games discord. Quite often you'll find the devs getting really engaged with whatever creations modders are coming up with, and having very good discussions with the community, clearly laying out plans and often delivering more than we could have hoped for in the community. This is one of those games that have been boosted by having such active and driven devs who genuinely care about the game.  Conclusion / Should I buy / TL:DR Teardown is a fantastic game filled with plenty of content to keep you busy. It more than is worth its initial cost and the content keeps growing from there. Personally I've found it to be exactly the game I had wanted for a long time but just hadn't seen delivered anywhere near as well as it has been here. 10/10 would recommend again."}, {"username": "pwnedgod", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "You like blocky games?You like destroying stuff?You like making shortcuts by blowing up buildings?You like abusing saves to achieve the perfect game?This is the game for you."}, {"username": "BadDorok749", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Everything goes \"BOOM\", including your own PC."}, {"username": "Embrace Ralsei", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Teardown development team:⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠋⠉⠈⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢏⣴⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⣾⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⢢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⠀⡴⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠶⢴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣁⡀⠀⠀⢰⢠⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⣴⣶⣿⡄⣿⣿⡋⠀⠀⠀⠎⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠗⢘⣿⣟⠛⠿⣼⣿⣿⠋⢀⡌⢰⣿⡿⢿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣧⢀⣼⣿⣿⣷⢻⠄⠘⠛⠋⠛⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣧⠈⠉⠙⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠈⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢃⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠴⢗⣠⣤⣴⡶⠶⠖⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡸⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⢠⣾⣿⠏⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠉⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠈⢹⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠈⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⡟⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠁⠀⠀⠹⣿⠃⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠉⠉⠁⠀⢻⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠈⣿⣿⡿⠉⠛⠛⠛⠉⠉⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⢀⣀⣠⡴⣸⣿⣇⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡿⠄⠙⠛⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⠄"}, {"username": "[NL] Imetysaw", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "With this game now launching in 1.0, I have to give it the due respect it deserves and give it a big thumbs up.When this game was first shown, I just thought \"looks like a cool tech demo, but that is all\".When it was then released in early access, I thought \"this is a seriously impressive piece of software, but I do not see it becoming an interesting game\".Now in it's current state, I will happily admit that I was completely wrong. The destruction is so satisfying, and all you wish for is more and more. During the campaign you often spend a large amount of time trying to plan stuff out, destroying things in a particular way, setting up planks and vehicles creatively such that you can get all the objectives done in time. When you then complete the level, it is super satisfying. Furthermore the campaign itself is also pretty interesting, with different types of level objectives available, with a nice background story to it all as well. The progression feels great too, with more tools of destruction becoming available to you over time.My utmost respect to the creators of Teardown.

I haven't tried the short moon yet, but if you are someone who has played resource management games before, I highly recommend you play on hard mode if you like your games to be challenging.Overall, I would give this game a 7/10, definitely very much worth the $5.00 price tag."}, {"username": "Four Friendly Brown Men", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "What a super cool little game.

It's humor and zany cutscenes have devolved since the older games, but the tradeoff is a complete rework including redone levels, an excellent combat system and an expansive galaxy that has a decently immersive effect.First, the Story: The story does a more accurate job of retelling the saga with tons of decent voiceacting (you can turn off voice acting with mumble mode to have an older LEGO experience. I will say though, mumble mode isn't single mumbles, they mumble out entire sentences, so it feels a little weird), the cutscenes work with or without voiceacting which is a surreal dynamic experience that the devs get my kudos on, but the levels themselves are really short and kind've disappointing. They introduce \"level challenges\", there are 3 in every level and they're alternative ways of going about each one. They're fun in general, but if you're trying to 100% they can be a nightmare sometimes. Minikits have been reduced from 10 to 5 per level, which was debatably my favorite part about replaying a level. Overall, cutscene and immersion-wise, the levels are fun to play and have the same great puzzle-solving they've always had, replayability is quite low though.First-Time through 9/10Free-Play 100% 6/10 (basically, thank god they're short)Now Galaxy-Mode was easily the most fun I've had through the whole experience. Instead of collecting gold bricks to a grand total of 250, (using the Marvel Avengers game as the mold here since it's the last one I 100%'d, god it sucked), there are 1,160 bricks, (known as \"kyber bricks\") that are collectable through completing level challenges, collecting minikits, getting \"true jedi\" on each level, doing side quests among 33 planets, destroying kyber comets, smuggling, doing bounty hunts, and puzzles on each and every planet. It was a ton of fun to mark each planet off the list as I collected each planets' worth. Some quests can only be done if you've progressed through the story up until that point, or until you've done other side quests. Personally, I recommend playing the base game all the way through 4-6, 1-3, 7-9, THEN doing galaxy-mode, so there will be less holdups. In advance, there was only 1 planet that gave me trouble and it was Endor, my guess is, the fire VFX would keep spawning as you laoded new areas, and it wouldn't unload areas your're not in anymore so the constant fire VFX made it a laggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Other than that, the quests and puzzles are really fun to complete.9/10, it is the after-story experience you want.I'll wrap it up here with the UI, combat/upgrade system, and the red bricks rework.So the Ui for the most part is pretty straightforward, might take a bit of learning but once you have it down, it all makes sense, stuff goes where it should go, changing characters is a bit messy and if you have OCD about how you want your free-play characters organized, that might be a huge problem because thats the only place where the UI falters heavily. Once you play, you'll figure out what I mean.The combat system is EXTREMELY intricate, you have a third person firing mode with guns and saber-throwing. There's also cover you can hide behind (and rebuild if it gets destroyed) and shoot from if you want to play that way. The biggest highlight though is the melee combat system. You initiate combat with a standard attack which can then go into changeups like heavy attacks, uppercut moves, and spike moves, depending on which corresponding button you press. These changeups become extremely prevalent in the lightsaber boss duels which make you feel like you control how the corresponding movie-scene flows.The red brick rework has been made easier to manage and deal with, you don't collect red bricks, instead you collect \"Data cards\" (1 per particular planet) in galaxy mode. They aren't specific to certain extras, you get the data card and choose which extra you want. (I recommend not buying anything until you get your first data card and do the stud multiplier route, things are hella expensive this time around so I'd say focus on getting all multipliers before you buy anything else) That being said \"Stud magnet\" and \"Fast build\" aren't extras anymore, they're \"Upgrades\"The upgrade system integrates things like collecting studs, building faster, sprinting quicker, having more health, doing more damage, etc. which is where kyber bricks come in, as they are used as it's currency, plus an additional stud fee. (Now this is the exception to my advice about \"not buying anything\", buy upgrades when you can) There are core upgrades and class upgrades for specific character types, (Jedi, Hero, Bounty Hunter, Scoundrel, Scavenger, Villain, Dark Side, Astromech Droids, Protocol Droids, and Extras.) all of which have their own abilities and uses.All of these features really make the experience flow a lot smoother and are a perfect 10/10 for me.TL;DR: buy the game if you've been wanting a decent Lego Star Wars game, things are different for the better, mumble mode is there, and if you get deluxe, you get classic character packs (if nostalgia is your thing) among other misc. character packs. red bricks have been changed into a more easily flowing system, and the combat = good.Big word of advice: once you're in galaxy mode, buy the rumor for the character \"Grummgar\", complete all the missions to get him and you get to run really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fast around some of these bigger planets to complete your side quests."}, {"username": "Koshō", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "As a veteran Lego Star Wars fan, I have mixed feelings.This game is great on a technical level, having all 9 of the movies in one package.

This review is largely negative, as I found a lot more to be critical of, than I was surprised and engaged by. I initially loved the game, and poured a lot of time into it and the fan wiki. It is very unfortunate that I have to write this review, but I cannot recommend this game in good faith.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Positives!- The atmosphere at the start of the game is really great! You genuinely care about the background characters you bump into.- Lots of care went into the designs of the Coromon themselves. The spritework and ideas are pretty good, but fall flat for some.- The Potent/Perfect system of having different colours for Coromon is interesting! It does funnel you into spending more time trying to acquire the better Coromon, but thankfully they're only useful for PVE. They patched the game to make it where your Perfect Coromon in PVP are only for bragging rights, and the stats aren't completely overwhelming between players with and without Perfects.- The developers are actively present and communicative with their community. The Coromon Discord is a bustling and alive place, full of people helping each other and sharing discoveries.- After a terrible initial launch, the developer team certainly flogged themselves to patch the game quickly, and resolve major technical problems with the game that players were having. The game is still a little un-optimised and stutters at times, but it is a functional game as of April 2022.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Negatives!Story and World-building- The story is just bad and unfinished. The villains are a cliche'd mess, with a cheap \"we are space refugees, looking to terraform your world to save our inter-dimensional, apocalypse-ravaged society\" backstory, thrown in right at the end. It isn't established early on. They are just \"evil alien invaders\" which you're then gaslit into caring about, in the final seconds of the game. This is also not something you are directly told. You have to go out of your way to interact and talk with the aliens themselves as they celebrate on the final level, and THEN they tell you their motivation. You can completely skip their purpose in this game, if you don't interact with them.- The Titan essence collection plot isn't really established well. You aren't told why you need to go about and preserve their essences, until the end of the game, when a reason is haphazardly thrown onto you that you need to \"save the planet's equilibrium\" that wasn't mentioned until that point.- The NPC dialogue is also not the greatest... In the beginning it was charming, and slowly it lost its gleam and you're hit over the head with constant popular culture references, to try to get some response out of you. An unexpected and charming example includes the Spinner Seller in the Desert town. A terrible dialogue example is when you finally get to the Ice town, the final city of the game, and you are beaten over the head with more Skyrim' references.Map and Level Design- It is a puzzle game primarily! Every 'area' of the game that is followed by a boss, has a puzzle aspect. These range from okay, contextually-appropriate puzzles like sliding ice puzzles; to terrible, tedious slogs (such as the Illuginn Purrghy segment.)- The map is surprisingly small. What feels like an expansive setting that you're constantly clearing 'fog' from in the world map to discover more areas, just ends abruptly. It is like being asked to draw a circle, and you draw a moon crescent. It's a good effort, but it feels like there is some significant space that could have been filled.- Speaking of the map, the towns in the game become less and less interesting to visit. The NPCs in each area are not memorable either, as you quickly run out of side quests that tie you to the personalities of each town. The polish of the pre-Donar Island areas is sadly not present later in the game.Other Issues- The music is okay, if not repetitive and generic at times. I found myself playing the majority of the game with only sound effects, and the music turned off. - Money is a real problem at the start of the game. Spinners, healing cakes... Everything just costs a ridiculous amount of gold, in comparison to the amount of Battle Researchers you actually get to fight at that point. The devs try their best to balance this, by adding a shocking abundance of barely-hidden secret items throughout the game. Unfortunately, you have to wait until you're more than halfway through the game to receive the Gauntlet Module that acts as this game's \"itemfinder\". Having that be much earlier in the game would be nicer for newer players, when they're desperate for the incredibly expensive store-bought items. Otherwise, it could guide players to cut costs, and not invest in Spinners, leading to less discovery of rarer Coromon.- For the variety of Coromon that there is, you certainly do see the same species a lot. I don't think it's necessary to still have this game's version of \"Pidgey\" and \"Rattata\" appearing within the final areas of the game.- The level balancing is terrible. All of the Titans act as unfair and sometimes unreachable benchmarks for your team, and the wild Coromon scale so strangely in level, between areas of the game. You have to have your Squad 20 levels above whatever the Wild Coromon are, at all times, otherwise you would be severely under-levelled for the Titan.- The Titans are incredibly bad, with Illuginn (the SECOND boss in the game) being an actually unfair difficulty curve for players. Between the constant stat-debuffs, high damage output and level, and the unique and ridiculous ability to put YOUR INACTIVE PARTY COROMON TO SLEEP, Illuginn is definitely one of the worst-designed bosses in recent video game history. The surefire way to defeat it is to use equally underhanded tactics in return, and rely on evasion buffs and debuffs to try to dodge some of Illuginn's terror. - The other Titans are sadly a walk in the park, compared to the beast that is Illuginn. Sart only summons some wild Coromon to battle you for a turn. Hozai gives itself some buffs and reduces the SP of your party to zero once (which would be interesting, but you can easily cure this with a SP recovery Cake or Skill).

I started out pretty excited by the setting and style of gameplay, but quickly found that there really wasn't much to the progression or the combat, and even the random encounters started repeating pretty quickly. It all starts to feel the same pretty quick, and whereas with the first character I did some exploring and bounties and such, it quickly became apparently that not only was that pretty pointless, but you'd just be repeating the same things over and over. Even upgrading weapons seemed pointless given the amount of effort it took to collect silver or gold ore, when you could just start buying legendary weapons from shops. And honestly, there wasn't a big difference between a purple or orange weapon.\"Nimp relics\" are the currency you use to unlock abilities, but even playing on Hard, it quickly became apparent that other than 1 or two abilities (like becoming immune to damage for a few seconds, or healing), none of them really mattered. Just pull out a fast-firing pistol and mow everything down during that invulnerability period. If that particular character doesn't have invulnerability, just grab some med packs or I guess actually use cover. I think I had 30+ nimp relics at one point because I just didn't bother spending them anymore, especially when you know the upgrade will go away as soon as you start the next character. And once I got a relic that auto-reloaded my weapon upon getting a kill, things got kind of ridiculously easy in combat.The stealth mechanic was kind of OP in the early game (since you could one-shot KO someone from behind from stealth, but a normal fight would take like 5-6 shots), but also quickly became pointless. All it would do is draw the missions out, so other than a few keys spots where I didn't want to murder innocent people, I didn't use it from the 2nd character on. Was hoping more would happen with the setting... it was an interesting premise but just didn't have enough weird random encounters and stuff for me to feel like it really took advantage of it. Story was fine. If this game had gone much past 20+ hours, though, there's no way I would have finished.

Its a largely open world and very novel action RPG where what you do, and how you do it is largely left up to you - at any time the game will offer you several things you can do, and nothing which you have to do. I thought I wouldnt like the walking mechanic, but actually I really do. Its quite simulation heavy, which is a style of game I like. Its pretty chill most of the time, apart from some exciting and challenging manoeuvres, or enemy fights. Its also a game which gets better as you get better at playing it, which is nice. Whats awful? The vehicle physics. I mean the physics is simply, truly, awful. It makes cyberpunk 2077s ♥♥♥♥ vehicle physics look and feel good. Just wow, thats a low bar and to easily slide under is mind boggling. I quite liked the bike physics in \"Days Gone\", and if we compare the two its literally universes apart. It was easily my single biggest source of frustration. Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful. I could keep going on, and because it is so completely terrible, I will. The really interesting thing is that vehicle physics in games is quite well studied, just think of the sheer number of racing games, not to mention all the GTAs and their clones, etc. I mean, what happened here? Its like a sadist and  masochist got together and asked \"how can we make the players lives truly awful\" and this was their response. So looking fwd to not playing this ever again for that reason. If youve played MGS5, and want something which feels a bit similar while being super novel, give this a go.Some tips for new players: 0/ just get out of the initial region ASAP - you'll unlock lots of stuff which will make it far faster to max out this region later. Be smart about being a completionist.1/ Build roads as soon as you can, these will pay dividends - although if easy, do so after youve unlocked a region as the game only make you pay 1/3rd the cost to finish the road. I built the majority of roads paying the full cost however to make it easier to unlock new regions and with some planning its not too bad.2/ Build zip lines as soon as you can, these will pay dividends, and gets you as close as you will get to flying.3/ Always \"special delivery\" your cargo trip as soon as this is an option, but note the timed ones, you will need a good plan."}, {"username": "V", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I connected all the facilities in the original game and build every road on the map.And I will do it all over again."}, {"username": "Paul", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Death Stranding is the most detailed, mechanically sophisticated and audiovisually spectacular... delivery boy simulator.I actually find it quite amazing how Kojima Productions can handle such a necessary but common activity in a way that makes it solid entertainment for a nice 50+ hours. Just starting the journey in Sam's shoes - a nice intro in a landscape that looks like Iceland, a visit to a cave, a strange invisible monster, the beautiful Lea Seydoux, cryptic dialogue and a fascinating atmosphere. Then the first two chapters, where strange characters with strange names like DieHardman or Deadman, Mama or Heartman say strange things and brandish unfamiliar terms that the protagonist Sam obviously knows but I have no idea about. Of course, as the game progresses, everything is gradually explained, often through various text logs and emails, although even after finishing, I for example still don't know what the acronym DOOMS stands for, if it's actually an acronym for anything at all. And the amusingly literal/weird character names are of course also explained in overlong Kojima-style cutscenes and dialogue, like:Hi, I'm Seven Dead Kids Murphy. Why do they call me that? That's a great story. I had seven kids and they all died. The first one died in a car accident. The second died in a rock-climbing accident. The third was an illness... I think? After a while, I stopped paying attention. Oh, and my first name is Murphy. Like Murphy's Law, you know? What a coincidence, huh? But I got the name mostly because of the kids. Who are dead. All seven of them. But enough about the tragic past, can you deliver these underpants to South Knot City? At times, the story comes across as unintentionally funny (although the princess beach scene must have been a cringe on purpose, no one can convince me otherwise), but as a whole it is fascinating and at times genuinely moving. Mads Mikkelsen is great as always, his charisma working as a magnet, so even if half the game his scenes are just context-free shorts with his kid, it's still fun to watch.Why \"only\" 80? Because...despite the sophistication of the gameplay mechanics and the fascination with the world and story, I couldn't help almost falling asleep at times - especially the third chapter, which was maybe 15 hours long and story-free 99% of the time, really tested my patience. And of course...as I wrote, despite all the sophistication, the story, the amazing moments when Silent Poets or Low Roar start playing after a thrilling crawl through a canyon full of BT monsters...it's still all about delivering packages.

I can even get ambushed by thieves who insist on stealing my money, only to find I don't carry any and they can in fact do nothing to me.

These are pulled straight from Japanese folklore and urban legends. The most basic enemy, Rain Walker, is born because its human predecessor was drive to exhaustion by their work. And thus, in revenge, they drain life force from living and breathing humans. Every single enemy has a short backstory like this in the game, making you feel even more immersed. To face these evil entities, you are given your own arsenal of supernatural powers thank to KK’s ties to the spirit world. You have three basic abilities you unlock early on, each useful for different situations. There is the rapid-fire wind, explosive fire, and close-range water, each with their own supply of “ammunition”, which you replenish by breaking surrounding spirit objects. This whole set up forces you to be mobile in combat and never stand for too long in one spot otherwise you either risk being swarmed by enemies or running out of ammo. As there are ways to deal damage, there are some for avoiding damage. You can either dodge aside by simply moving or block the incoming attack. With precise timing, you can even get a perfect block, which negates all the damage. From personal experience, I can say that moving around is way more effective and safer than trying to block attacks coming from all sides. If you, however, do manage to get hit, do not fret. There is a hefty amount of healing items. Regular food not only heals you but also increases your overall max health, so eating is advised. Otherworldly food items give you temporary buffs to your skills or stats that diminish over time.On top of that, as you progress through the game, you will gain access to supportive talismans, which are one-use items that replace stereotypical FPS grenades. There are 4 distinctive types, again each useable in different scenario. Two of them are made for loud combat and two of them will make stealth easier. On topic of stealth, you have a few tools up your sleeve if you are a kind of player who enjoys sticking to the shadows and backstabbing everything alive. You can either get close and personal behind a Visitor, getting an easy kill (unless they are a tougher enemy or a boss) or use your trusty bow to snipe them from afar. The choice is ultimately up to you as well as is the playstyle. Collectathon in my open-world?!Ghostwire is not afraid to show its huge amount of collectable content within the game.  You have 240 thousand spirits to liberate, found in bunches ranging from 100 to 700. That is a lot of souls to save. You can get the spirits as quest rewards, find them in the open-world or through wave-based fights. All of these are collected by using katashiro (paper dolls), which cap at 50 and you start only with ten so get to upgrading them as fast as possible. After you get done with the spirits, there is a lot of relics for you to gather. Luckily, each of the collectors will mark the approximate location on the map if you tag in their respective shops, making it just a quick fetch quest for a decent amount of money and new unlocks when certain number of requests for each individual shopkeeper has been completed.So, you gather up all the relics and think for yourself that you are already done. Then you remember that a speaking tanuki gave you a quest to find 25 of his disguised friends. Those 25 tanukis transformed into everything ranging from billboards to cup of noodles. Luckily each of them has a tail sticking out, making them recognizable.You also have numerous magatamas either in shops or in form of yokai, who each have a different mini task attached to them. If you want to unlock every single skill in the game, you need to get all of them.On top of that you have outfits as well as music that can be played at any point in the game, making the exploration feel a bit more epic.In summary, massive chunk of content is collecting these items, so if you are not fan of gathering items and just running around the city, looking for all kinds of weird items, be vary. Why is this not Dying Light?Simple answer is lack of parkour moves. This game has jump button, simple climbing mechanics for getting on top of ledges, grappling hook and the ability to glide. To be completely objective here, the movement in Ghostwire does not feel nowhere as refined as in Dying Light. The climbing is often clunky and grabbing onto ledges changes into spamming spacebar after jumping. The fully upgraded grappling hook has unclear grapple points and again will result into you holding right click and mashing spacebar while aiming at the roof of a building to make sure you can grapple there. You simple cannot use the hook ability anywhere you wish to.However, this moveset is enough for you to make the exploration enjoyable. It was fun to glide across the Shibuya district with the tunes from the in-game musical player. Even with the rather simplistic mechanics, it was fun gathering up every single collectable. But do not expect the free-form movement that Dying Light offers.Akito + KK=BromanceThe duo of Akito and KK carried the story heavily. Their relationship that simply starts as KK being a parasite, sitting in Akito’s body developed into a closely tied friendship, where everything depends on utmost trust. I loved every single interaction between those two and was excited to see what new shenanigans the pair will bring to my screen. This was crucial as the overall narrative is very simplistic in nature. Evil man steals your sister and wants to connect the underworld with the human world. Normal Japanese anime stuff. Luckily for you, the main duo is stunning and almost never gets dull. If we exclude the repeated voice lines when it comes to side content. The same cannot be said about the supporting cast, which there is a few of. You do not get to know them a lot and it feels like they were placed in the game just it would not just be Akito and KK trying to stop Hannya’s evil schemes. Both Reiko and Ed, the rest of KK’s team are also spirits. Ed only talks through voice recordings when using the phone, whereas Reiko gets a bit of a screen time. Sadly, both characters are massively under-developed and feel like a fluff so the story would not feel entirely empty.Killing ghosts is easyAs with any game that has levels and character progression, if you do all the side content first, you will be massively overpowered. That made the end game bosses ridiculously easy. Don’t get me wrong, each of the major bosses has a unique and terrifying design with unique mechanics. However, those do not matter as you become a literal god amongst ghosts. That is my biggest issue with the game. I wish there would be any scaling in place or at least recommended levels for both the main quests and side-quests. EpitaphIf you are not afraid of doing a bit of leg work collecting things while battling supernatural entities, grab this game right away. And also, if you are fan of Japanese culture.PC specsCPU: Intel Core i5 10400FGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SuperRAM: 8GBResolution: 1920 x 1080Performance: 40-60 FPS on low-medium settingsWant to hunt other high quality reviews?

I am a wicked scavenger so I love hunting for things and the search is thrilling to me. In truth I had the most fun running around the city searching every nook and cranny for every last trinket and critter and I was successful in finding them all. I also enjoyed the flavour text and reading all the descriptions and KK Notes in full. I know this can be boring and tedious to some people but that's why if you want to not bother with it, you can just play through the story. The story is of a mad scientist and his efforts into separating the soul from the body  but focused around a young man fused with a ghost who was one such soul separating from his body. They team up to kick ass and reverse the separation and put everyone back into their bodies. It's a very quick story to get through and the ending got me super emotional. Tears lined my face I tell ya! I would be interested in a sequel of sorts to see if Akito (young man protagonist) continues to vanquish otherwordly foes or help those with spirit problems. Definitely room to expand the world or leave it as it is.I think it's a lovely game for sure. It balances campy with grit very nicely but won't be a game for everyone. Which is something that can be said for all games really. Do give it a go if what I said entices you. :)"}, {"username": "Omega Bard", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "This is more of a Maybe, but you know steam.At it's core, it's a beautiful and well polished game, with enjoyable combat, an amazing atmosphere, and a lot of unique ideas.  It focuses around Japanese folklore, which normally I don't care about, but it makes each new discovery interesting.  It then adds on a huge amount of collectibles of various types, randomly hidden all throughout the city, which improve your character in some way - which can be discouraging for some, but I found it engagingUnfortunately, that's part of the problem; I did a lot of the sidequests, and collected a lot of things.  I'm now 8 hours in and have fully upgraded all my combat abilities, and I don't think there's really anywhere left to go.  This is what combat is going to be like for the next 30 hours or so.  Which is sorta fine, because it's still enjoyable, but I'm not sure it will be enjoyable 30 hours later.  Otherwise, many of the quests are also very hollow; they exist only to show you some creature from folklore, and then you hold down the 'absorb power' button and it dies and you get a reward.The rewards also stop feeling rewarding when you see that after 8 hours of meticulously grabbing every one you find, you're at 20,000/250,000 And speaking of finding things - you get an ability with no cooldown, that lets you see any interactable object, or enemy, through walls in any direction, for quite a long distance.  This makes the collectible business trivial and tedious; every few steps you stop, press the hotkey, look around/up/down/everywhere, try to figure out if any of the dozen outlines currently being shown are anything useful, move forward a few more steps, repeatSo, it's a maybe for me.  I still plan to keep going with it, and just avoid/ignore the collectibles, and see how it all plays out.  And on its surface, it really does look and feel great.  I just have suspicions that it can't keep up the pace for another 30 hours, especially now that my tech tree is already basically full"}, {"username": "lucis", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "The map is absolutely gorgeous and detail-rich, I've played alot of games set in Shibuya and this rendition blows everything out of the water by order of magnitudes. It is quite simply one of the best maps I've ever seen in a videogame.EDIT: I've taken a closer look at the street layouts and it seems that while major landmarks are in the game, less known places and backstreets aren't accurate to the real Shibuya, instead just imitating the Tokyo look in general. Places like, Shibuya Stream, Miyashita Park, Modi, Spain Hill, Cat Street, Udagawa, Takeshita Street, etc. aren't in the game. Nonetheless, it's a gorgeous map even without its accuracy.But that's where the good things end. This is a game entirely carried by its environment. The combat is underdeveloped and gets dull quickly, there's barely any enemy variety, the open world activities are basically a bunch of ubisoft tier collectathons, and the story feels like a complete afterthought with how uninteresting it is.It feels like what happened here is that they made the map and then realized they had to make a game around it, so they scrambled to fill it up with content and shipped it as soon as possible. This is a rushed product, not in the usual sense of being buggy, but in the sense that its core concepts haven't been developed enough.I'd love to see Ghostwire becoming a series that takes us to different places across the world with their local environment und culture on display, but before that can happen, Tango Gameworks has to sit down and rework the mechanics of Ghostwire. Make the combat deep and engaging beyond some sparkly animations. Give us a great range of different enemies that we actually have to approach differently from each other. Invest time into making a compelling story with interesting characters. And make open-world content that makes the exploration of your beautiful worlds even more fun rather than less so. Ghostwire has alot of potential and can become a great game series, but as it currently stands it's not there yet. Final verdict: great map, mediocre gameplay. 5/10Buy it if you want to walk through Shibuya, but otherwise your time and money is better spent elsewhere."}, {"username": "Conker", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I've seen lots of open-world games set in Japan, but this one does something truly amazing!Although the game lacks variety and most side tasks seem repetitive for an open-world game, the visual of the city occupied by spirits in Japanese folklore is gorgeous and hunting ghosts using the combat system based on Kuji-kiri looks super cool.Besides, you are allowed to pet a Shiba Inu dog wandering on empty streets, buy items and foods at convenience stores run by Yokai cats, and play hide-and-seek with Tanuki known as shape-shifting raccoon creatures, which means there are no reason for someone who loves Japanese cultures to hesitate to buy this game!If you feel interest in any of these, trust me, Ghostwire: Toyko will be your type of game :D일본을 배경으로한 오픈월드 게임은 많이 봤지만 이 게임은 정말이지 취향저격이었던 작품.오픈 월드 게임 치고는 샌드박스 요소가 적고 부가 퀘스트 또한 반복적인 편이지만, 일본 도시괴담에 단골로 등장하는 초자연적인 존재들에게 점령당한 도쿄를 그려낸 훌륭한 비주얼, 그리고 육갑비축을 기반으로 한 귀신들과의 전투 만큼은 놀라운 퀄리티를 자랑한다.게다가 떠돌이 시바견 쓰다듬기, 고양이 요괴들이 운영하는 편의점에서 아이템을 구입하고, 타누키(일본 신화에 주로 등장하는 변신 너구리)와 숨바꼭질하기 등의 컨텐츠를 맛볼 수 있기에 일본 문화를 좋아하는 사람이라면 더더욱 구매를 망설일 필요가 없는 작품이라고 보는 중.조금이라도 구미가 당긴다면, 분명 취향에 맞는 게임이 될 테니 꼭 한번 플레이해볼 것을 권장한다!"}]}, {"game_id": "1905180", "game_title": "OBS_Studio", "price": "Free", "overall_score": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Souls-like", "Psychological Horror", "Story Rich", "Video Production", "Software", "Utilities", "Dating Sim", "LGBTQ+", "Free to Play", "Horror", "Survival Horror", "Anime", "Audio Production", "Web Publishing", "FPS", "Open World", "Great Soundtrack", "Puzzle", "Family Friendly", "Action"], "reviews": [{"username": "Dragon", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "better than sex"}, {"username": "Sami392", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "If you're looking for a review on this software you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pieDirections:1.

The game is being frequently described as a \"souls-like Link to the Past\" which I feel is unfair. While there are very immediate and central connections to LttP, I wouldn't describe souls-like as very apt. There is a death mechanic, a parry, and an upgrade system, but the vibe isn't at all like dark souls and outside of the parry, the other two similarities don't feel all that similar either. The difficulty isn't nearly as high or feel as punishing. I'd describe as slightly more difficult than casual. This game is very responsive, intuitive and holds a incredible amount of character. I had been following this game's development for maybe 6 or 7 years and in that span of time there have been a huge amount of games modeled on the link to the past format. I was worried that my experience would suffer from the market's oversaturation, but this game does an exceptional job of keeping you engaged and interested. The primary storytelling and mechanics-explaining vehicle is based on an in-game instruction manual that you pick up pieces of bit-by-bit and I love everything about it. There is so much attention to detail, a plethora of subtle/enticing hints, and puzzles that are legitimately difficult and frustrating that feel genuinely rewarding.This is probably the best game in the genre that I've played since Hyper Light Drifter.

Short, wide, had a mess of scrawny legs that looked like spaghetti noodles. I chose him because he was funny looking. Then, as it turns out, he couldn't walk. He only had three of those spaghetti noodle legs. This led to me having to take care of him once every minute or two. Bringing food for him to eat, scratching him so he felt better, or telling him to sleep. Mud became a huge thorn in my side.When my first dog died, I fed Mud the core because I didn't know what it did and was just messing around. Turns out, it extends your dog's life, so I sighed, knowing I'd have to put up with him for even longer. I was wanting Mud to die so I could stop having to care for him so often, and I'd just unknowingly extended the waiting game. Finally, I got the notification that Mud was going to die soon. But, instead of the relief I thought I would feel, I felt sad. I did not want to lose Mud anymore. He had been around for so long. Sure, I had to care for him every minute or two, but he has been with me, through thick and thin. I fed Mud another core, and I have two more in storage for him.

I do not negatively review flippantly, and do so reluctantly. But I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, except to a highly select audience.I give Visual Concepts credit where it's due. They've inherited a series from a dev team who worked on it for decades, and during some very difficult circumstances, managed to produce a reasonably functional and stable game that does an arguably acceptable job of exploiting the series' strengths while adding some interesting twists to the formula. And they did this after taking two and a half years off following the troubled launch of WWE 2K20, to try to get it right. I commend them for that, and for creating what is a reasonably enjoyable experience when it works.The new MyGM mode, though limited compared to classic GM modes, has been a surprise standout for me. Setting it up, trying to figure out what will get the highest ratings, and managing a show budget are unexpectedly addictive.This year's Showcase, a historical career retrospective focusing on Rey Mysterio that stretches from WCW to his current stint with his son Dominik, is fun and doesn't overstay its welcome. Transitions between archival video footage and angle-perfect gameplay in that mode are a fantastic presentational touch. Along with the period-accurate visual filters and lighting used in many of those venues and broadcasts.While not a fan of combos, and most of what's on offer here is a mere reshuffling of states and actions with different inputs, the new control scheme is likely beginner-friendlier.Each of the game's modes - from the card collecting MyFaction, to MyGM's management options, to Universe Mode's full micromanagement of everything, to MyRise's branching career mode - feels distinct, self-contained, and in and of themselves fun. Unfortunately, a lack of cross-mode integration was step one in my inexorable spiral toward frustration. I spend a lot of time in these games' creation modes. I spent days carefully creating my custom CAS, which I planned to use in MyRise. Maddeningly, that's not something 2K22 permits. You cannot import a created superstar into MyRise. Nor can you export your MyRise character to other modes.Putting care and effort into a CAS is a sizable time investment. Having no way to use them in this game's career mode is simply not a user-friendly design. Recreating them entirely for MyRise is just as bad.I ended up making a cartoonish CAS I threw together in moments instead, because it simply wasn't worth the effort.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784244540I then moved onto MyFaction. I found it enjoyable. You create a deck of cards representing specific superstars, and then play them in matches to level them up and unlock additional cards. Some cards reveal otherwise inaccessible superstars, such as classic versions of characters. Except... yet again... these unlockable characters cannot be used outside of MyFaction. It's counterintuitive, and killed any sense of payoff for grinding.These odd limitations litter the game. There are no mid-card titles in MyGM Mode (and while tag team titles were added as of v1.09, they are available only on certain difficulties.) Promos have been removed from Universe Mode. This year's custom entrances are far simpler affairs, with many important options gutted entirely, supposedly to avoid issues present in 2k20.And unfortunately, that brings me to my single biggest issue with this release. \"It hits different!\" That's 2K22's slogan. \"Redesigned engine.\" These are things you can read on storefronts. Yet while more stable overall, the game is packed with the same legacy issues that have plagued the series for years. And some new ones. The title screen failed to acknowledge any input for nearly 40 seconds if I downloaded too many community creations. Load times when using created superstars and arenas grew to 4 minutes. There is clipping through body parts during entrances, despite tight limits being placed on entrance creation and other measures supposedly introduced to avoid this. Hair looks and animates just as jankily and rough as ever. Many In-game superstar faces look less accurate than community creations do.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2788025464Online play is marred by lag and disconnects (which costs rewards.) There's no variable refresh rate support. As of v1.09, display resolution cannot be set above native (e.g. no DSR.) Altering attires for existing superstars introduces permanent geometry warping on certain in-game models. As in 2K20 there is a soft limit on total user created images before issues emerge. Once exceeded, images on downloaded wrestlers simply vanish. Nothing warns players of this. I worked for days on a CAS only for one eye to become permanently frozen (more wasted time, & this is an old bug.) Universe is buggy (custom arenas don't save to shows consistently, invisible wrestlers attack you, titles don't change hands as cutscenes say they have, etc.) Bugged custom belts are blank.Then there is the UI and general user experience. The editor has flashing selection highlights that cover fine details and can't be disabled. Minor accessibility features enabled by users don't work online. UI leaves some players uncertain what to do in MyRise. You can climb to the top of ladders and leap off inside the ring, but not outside it. HIAC (and other) throws feel hit or miss. I ran into upload bugs, too.Worst of all: I lost 100+ hours of progress & creation work to a simple reinstall. (Manually back up your saves.)Conclusion2K22 is a game I wanted to love. I have the hours to prove it. I'll continue the struggle to extract enjoyment from it. But in its current state it doesn't feel like it respects my time, money, or intelligence. For every moment of fun, there is a frustrating restriction or technical flaw that makes it a grind to get the most out of. There have been some very high profile \"worst launches ever\" in recent years. Yet those games were islands of functionality and stability in comparison to this one. They got hate-trained, while actual broken annualized sports IPs get a pass year after year. Enough is enough.I've played this series for 22 years.

Your sole means of visuals of the outside is a camera that takes a few seconds to create a grainy picture. The goal is to travel to all points of interest and make a picture.The game has a late 90s PC/Playstation aesthetic, but where it really shines is the sound design.

As in The Moon Sliver you're journey to what seems to be your goal, might ultimately end with something you're either already expecting or rather not think about.If you've never touched his games, you can expect a short experience which is in return for it's rather little playtime boiled down to the core essence of what makes a horror game great, at least in my opinion. The setting tells it all. You're alone, navigating a small submarine in a blood ocean on an alien moon. You can't look out of the window, only take snapshots with your camera.There is no marker on your map so you'll have to navigate via coordinates. I actually liked this idea and the game itself isn't so long that it starts to get tedious. You'll have to take a certain number of pictures to complete your mission. An alarm is kicking off when you're getting to close to a wall - and it never stops until you're increased the space inbetween. The sense of danger, of dread and the classic fear of that what lurks in the dark and can't be seen - yet heard - makes this little game very special. The soundeffects are very disturbing and well placed, making your claustrophobic situation even worse. Even though there is literally no replayability I highly recommend Iron Lung for its great atmosphere and unique gameplay.

But that helps greatly with the atmosphere. After 10 minutes of gameplay, you know what to do and how to do it. So when something does happen, no matter how small, it can elevate the experience and mystery more then most other games.---{Graphics}---☐ A reflection of reality!☐ Gorgeous!☑ Great!☐ Better than Minecraft.☐ It barely passes the test.☐ PS1 graphics are better.The graphics are stylized as a PS1 game. It's nothing new, but it does make the game that much more mysterious. Old games have a way of leaving a lot up to the imagination. And Iron Lung is just like that. You're completely encased by the walls of the submarine. And the only means of seeing outside is with a slow, unreliable camera. Which only gives you so much to go off of. Despite the game looking and playing the exact same, it manages to do so much with so little!---{Audio}---☐ Better then actual music!☑ Pretty great!☐ Better then most games!☐ About average.☐ Nothing special.☐ As bad as nails against a chalk board.Iron Lung is one of the few horror games i've played where sound isn't important for the gameplay. It's sole purpose is to immerse you, and it does an excellent job at it. If you hear something, and you don't know where or what it came from, it can be very unnerving. This game uses that uneasy feeling a lot. Most of the time, you're only idea of what's outside is whatever noise it's making. And since the noise isn't recognizable to us, we can only imagine what it could be.---{Soundtrack}---☐ Buy the soundtrack. Just buy it!☐ I listen to it in my spare time!☑ Good!☐ Eeeeehhh.☐ Just mute it in options.☐ Nothing. Silence.The soundtrack is pretty simple, but really livens up the ambiance. While playing, it's usually silent, which is often more unsettling than any music. But during the more dramatic parts, the soundtrack really improves the horror!---{Atmosphere}---☑ It's so dense you could cut it with a knife!☐ I take a moment to appreciate it every now and then!☐ Quite enjoyable!☐ It works well enough.☐ Welp... they tried.☐ Little to none.This game takes advantage of the imagination, and uses it against us. By giving the player only a little bit to go off of, we're forced to fill in the rest. And what we come up with is often more horrific then whatever the developer could make. The mystery of what could be out there, what it looks like, and what if can do, is genius.---{Story}---☐ You'll deeply invest yourself into it!☑ Really good!☐ Enough to not skip the cut-scene!☐ Glimpses of good writing.☐ Better then Hotel Mario.☐ No story anywhere.Again, we're given very little story wise.

The games art is awesome, the battles change every game, and the fear creatures are very unique. The game at first sight might look simple but it actually gets more complex as you play. Its also nice that this game is very free to play but it of course as all games do has a pay to win aspect. You can also play with friends and play 10 games at once and come back to them whenever you want which makes it really easy to play on your own time. If your looking for a strategy card game I would say this is one of the best ones out there and I have played A LOT. Overall this game definitely deserves a 9/10.Updated (I wanted to update my review on the game after 30 hours of game play)PROS:1.The game is very polished but could use some additions (noted below)2.The rewards received from jacks (reward system) and quests are scaled nicely3.Allows players to play against friends and even complete quests in friend battles (great feature)4.Allows for asynchronous playing and live play (each player in live seems to get a minute per turn)5. Art/animations/music is great6.The game is very intricate and new from any other game I've seenCONS:1.Game can seem pay to win if your cards are vastly under leveled. (But its understandable when a company needs to make money somehow, this aspect should be expected in virtually every game)2.In the live matches (arena mode) when you click your unit (fear) to move to a hex if the time runs out it stops where they are and doesn't continue the motion. (not sure if this is a bug or just a problem I found personally)3.There is a cap on resources (tears and experience) if you continue playing. (resets daily)4.The progression for obtaining coffee is to low, there should be ways to get more of it (maybe clan battles mentioned below)5.Some cards definitely seem way more utilized than others making other cards rarely if not never used.6.When you obtain to many cards there is no deck feature to remove unnecessary scrolling in battleADDITIONS:-Game needs a clan system of some sort with donations, clan wars, friendly battles, chat, etc.-Game needs emotes in both the asynchronous and especially the arena mode. (For asynchronous it could be to send out one emote per turn)-Game needs either a monthly or weekly tournament that players can enter for rewards-The game DEFINITELY needs a daily log in reward system to keep players coming back-Game NEEDS to uncap resources (tears and experience) even at a lesser amount is fine, but when a player keeps playing and there is no rewards beside coffee (resource) it feels very unrewarding. -There should be 2 re-rolls for quests daily instead of oneMy Thoughts:This game is one of the few games that doesn't have a battle pass and I applaud them for it. If they do include this aspect they should definitely keep it free. I think this game is fantastic and definitely needs some more attention from some of the big streamers to make it really shine. It has all the aspects to be a great game, but without all the additions I have mentioned this game will surely lose interest. If I could say this game was like anything else its like a mash up of Clash Royale, Legends of Runeterra, and Team Fight Tactics (of course there are other games but these are the ones that come to the top of the list for me). So after more hours under my belt i'm going to give this game a 8.2/10 because it has a huge room for improvement and if those additions are made it will no doubt become a 10/10."}, {"username": "TinadoIsStolen", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "monky mmmmm..."}, {"username": "neys.", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "a good strategy with a cool drawing style and not bad gameplay, there are not enough achievements and modes like 2v2 or clan wars, I liked it :)(I use google translate, so my review may not be quite correct in writing, sorry)"}, {"username": "Duke McGuiggs", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "This is the most fun strategic game i have played in a long time.

Very chess like; there is no random, all the numbers and values for you and your enemy are all laid out. You can read each enemy unit cards and see what they can do. No surprises aside from strategies you didn't think of. This is a game where you can really win from planning out many moves ahead, no matter what units you have. I've played against better players than me that won with, what seemed way worse units than I had out.Collecting all the monsters \"Phobies\" is also very addictive, you get new pieces that can really alter your strategy and the outcome of the game. The plays become an art and your strategy becomes a beautiful masterpiece, just like chess.Aside from that, this game is very polished. No bugs that I can think of (or seen yet), everything is very fluid and responsive. Well placed effects, pure eye candy for the most part.Edit: - I see a lot of reviews talking about this game as if it was only async; If you are looking for a non-async experience. There is arena mode, which is playing a full game right away against your opponent. You get 1 min (roughly i haven't counted) to do your turn and it flows quite well. I'm hoping to see tournaments in the future- I know some people wont like the pay model, however, to me its very similar to MTG. Except even better because you don't need new cards to win or stay competitive. But the choice is there and if you feel like being a collector and buy a few packs once in a while, you have that option. AFAIK server infrastructure to keep a multiplayer game alive, isn't exactly cheap, yet these guys are letting us play the full game for free. You even get new monsters from buying packs with the soft currency that you get from just playing.

My review covers the sheer experience of a PC setup and not on a Steam Deck. After a long time, Valve has finally come into the field of optimized games. But this particular segment is not hype-worthy. They put together all the efforts just to give a test/demo game for the Steam Deck. Yea, it’s all amazing for the Steam Deck, but what about PC users? Let’s break it down!  📝Story/Plot without spoilers: 🔸 As the name suggests, it’s a desk job. Like, what else to expect? But there’s a twist. This monotonous desk job takes a tremendous turn with every progression in the story. Being a quick game, most of the story elements will be spoiler worthy. So, start it up and enjoy! 🎮Gameplay: 🔸 It’s very challenging to fit this game into a genre spectrum. A narrative experience? Something that is laid back? Or a funny sequence? Let’s call it something that you play on a day when you are tired from your competitive grind. A game short enough and free to play that just helps you lift your mood. Push buttons, hear the narratives, respond accordingly, and be entertained.------🔹 As a sneak peek, you can expect some shooting-down mechanics, follow the instruction manual, and test some gyro mechanics if your controller supports it. I expected a lot of Easter eggs in this one. But sadly, there were no concrete ones. 📷Graphics: 🔸 The graphics were all amazing and immersive. I didn’t experience any lags nor a situation where the pictures were not matching the art style. The graphics are definitely depicting the Portal lore. Similar robots, known background environment and narrations. Overall, they put together a promising effort. 📝Main Pros and Cons: 🟩Pros-+A new Experience+Free to Play+Laid back controller gameplay+A treat for Portal fans 🟥Cons--Too short in content-Gyro segment is pointless without the necessary tools.✉️Miscellaneous Information:Keep your KBM ready-Even though it says only a controller is required, KBM will still be required in a particular segment of the game. It will ask you to press F12 to take a screenshot and drag your mouse to sign. So keep it ready!😇Verdict: 🔸 Yea, it’s all cool that Valve is awake. But not for PC users, just for the Steam Deck. It’s surely a fresh experience, plus being free to play is a good focus point. But even if you don’t play it, you are not missing out on a larger picture.

So far, after playing the Beta a bit and seeing the direction it's going, I like it. It's a fun game, with a lot of depth and the factions on the surface may seem similar, but with time to flesh out this will be a very fun game. Right now the issues I see are the lack of proper diversity with the cities, and only having a single city per region basically makes any bonuses to help defend the city are virtually useless. Complaints about the game being too hard are simply being made by people that are bad at video games. I've beaten a few games on easy and normal now and it's certainly not too hard. The complaint I will say is that there's virtually only one 'valid' play style, otherwise the game *is* impossible. In order to actually beat the game now, you basically have to throw all your units into a single doom-stack and run that around the map clearing out your starting area. If you don't do this, you'll capture everything in your area way too late and when you AI comes for you, you'll never stand a chance as they will simply doom-stack as well. There's virtually no viable way to make smaller armies useful right now because of the doom-stacks. If a lower unit cap was put on the generals, I think you'd greatly increase the play styles that were viable and allow people to actually think about their army comp beyond making their doom stack. Also, the inclusion of no proper multiplayer is baffling to me, why wasn't that out on release? You can steam play together with a friend and it actually works very well, but no proper multiplayer really should have been out on launch. So overall, a very good first impression, I do think it needs work and don't think it's 'complete' yet at all. I'm going to call it a 3.5/5 and with a few updates and a few small tweaks this will easily move up to 4.5 or 5 even.

You can cast spells or choose whether to be attacking or defensive, but you are otherwise in the hands of the fates. You will get an easy, moderate, hard or impossible information tag at each battle site to help you. Chances are you'll win all the easy battles but they still do vary in strength. I have gone in to easy battles and lost way more troops than I expected to. I suspect it has much to do with the type of troops you face.And this is something I love about the game. There are so many different types of troop and this is mainly because there are so many race types to play. The depth of choice in this game really is fantastic.I love the amount of battles you can face.

Then you'll slowly spread out to meet stronger enemies and eventually the AI opponents. The game is a sort of skirmish format with a set number of AI enemies. I've not actually met an AI yet (on smallest map size) but I've enjoyed the game so far still.I do love the amount of enemy types I've faced and I love the fact that new armies spawn across the map. There will always be something to fight.Each hero you own levels up and can pick from a good number of skills to improve their ability in battle. There are also spells and I'm dead impressed with the variety of skills and spells. I've had 5 or 6 heroes in my times so far playing this game and each has been so different. My first hero was able to recruit many new troop types after battles and my latest does a lot more damage whilst summoning elementals all over the fight maps. I'm really keen to see all the skills.There is one thing I've not liked so much up till now. In my first run I got so many troop types that it made it tough to organise things. When you have a lot of troops it squeezes the bar up. Add to this that the UI interface for your troops is not fullscreen and it can be a bit of a nuisance organising a lot of troops.What I do like in this regard is that when you do have a big army you don't go in to the battle with all your troops. Some will stay back as reserves that you can send in to battle at set intervals. I haven't done the tutorials (I'm gung ho, man) but I am sure there is a strategy to organising your armies and setting reserves so that you send just the right type of troop in to battle to change the course of war. I've had moments where my new troops arrive and I suddenly start destroying the enemy. I may be wrong. It is something I'll have to look in to.I just like the reserves mechanic though.Overall, I am just very impressed with the game. This is no early access title either. It's a full release and it's really rather cheap for the incredible amount of gameplay you get.Don't be put off by the graphics. It's really quite a pleasant experience to watch your troops battle it out in pixellated form.Thoroughly recommended game if you like your turn based strategy games."}, {"username": "Mike McPhil", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Fans of HoMM 2 & Especially 3 should just click buy now. Get the supporter pack, drop the $20, they deserve it. It's a small change to the formula (auto battles), but its engaging, and will keep you playing just like those legends did. Haven't seen much innovation in these types of games, other than what Fort Triumph did, but I'd say this is far more successful than that title (Tho do check out FT). Tons of races, maps, workshop support, all the goodies. No boring ass campaign either, but there is a tutorial to get you going.

The auto-battler combat immediately degenerates - sprites are about 8 pixels each and there's 100 of them on-screen at any time, so good luck having any idea what is going on once you click \"start battle\". Any pretense of strategy goes out the window 1 second into every fight. On a more subjective note, the aesthetic identity of each faction is severely diminished by the overly basic graphics and hands-off combat. All fights and units feel the same - you're just bloating your melee blob and your ranged blob and have to make sure your blob is always bigger than the enemy's blob. I'm not much of a graphics snob but the only way this game could be more visually confusing and uninspiring is if it was ASCII-based.On a much more objective and crippling note, this game's back-end AI is literally non-existant. Everything is scripted to prop the enemy faction(s) up throughout the game. The enemy doesn't have to do any of the things you do; Its units cost nothing. There is no limit to how many units it can recruit. Defeated heroes instantly respawn with bigger armies. This kind of ultra-transparent theatre really has no place in a strategy game in 2022 - even an auto-battler one. You could play through an entire campaign of M&B:Warband using only auto-resolve and get a more balanced and accurate experience. This is beyond basic and shouldn't be used for anything beyond early marketing footage, to actually have this as the engine for enemy players in-game is kind of a kick in the nuts.Considering the basic graphic profile of the game I'm not sure why it even needs to exist (sorry to be blunt). You can get better graphical fidelity - and a MUCH better game - from just buying Heroes of Might and Magic III on GOG. It'll prolly cost you less than a coffee and much, much less than this game.

After a few games of the same thing happening every time, I've found I'm not a fan and can't recommend it. If possible, I would refund because I'll probably never be touching it again. When the game is made to favor AI and gives them every advantage possible with fast troop spawn and infinite resources, it's not a challenge. It's just broken. I liked the concept. I liked the gameplay. I liked the different factions and powers. I HATED the unbalanced AI. Completely bogus. I shouldn't be getting out swarmed when I'm maximizing troop production from the start of the game. Yet somehow, the computer shows up with a twice my size army when it's possible to only recruit a certain number of troops each week. So how can they double my output of troops every game if I'm focusing on troop production and upgrade buildings? If it was a human player, they couldn't. But since it's AI and developers just love to give them some secret advantage on normal difficulty...they can.RE: Still not a fan after an additional 12 hours. Found that there's only one VIABLE way to play the game with every single faction. What's it matter to have different factions and units if they all still have to be played the exact same way to even stand a chance at winning a match? Unlike other strategy games which generally offer several different play styles or adaptive qualities to consider... Leaves it dull to have to play each game the same way to compete with broken ai. Not a good format for a strategy game."}, {"username": "Magic Ball", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Low playtime is because I originally got this from Itch.io first, then was given a Steam Key from that.The Good- Combat largely manages itself, but between spells and some basic movement instructions, you have some control- General management is very simple, from castle levels, to units promote once if at all.  There's some resources to manage, but beyond gold I've often had a mass excess of them.  Movement- Pixel art is pretty- Plenty of options for race, and they are different beyond just stat changes.The Bad- A learning curve.  For a while, the dominant strategy is melee up front range in back, hope the AI wins.  Figuring out what is good takes a lot of experimentation, as you often just win on numbers- Every game I've played, the AI always rushes me with some impossible army.  I generally start minimum tech level, and AI turns out around turn 15 or so with an army that proceeds to steamroll me and I lose.  After a few weeks pass, you've had time to level up and recruit your army, its fine.  Some maps, island based ones, usually alleviate this.- In larger games, like a Civilization Domination victory, there is usually a point you are incredibly stronger than the AI and it then feels more a chore to walk around and finish them off.  Easy fix is move on to another game yourself, but domination is the only victory.OverallPixel game inspired by Heroes of Might and Magic.  The learning curve is fun to go through, although it is there.  Many combats can be just won by outnumbering the enemy, but spells and organizing troops can decrease your loses greatly.

I haven’t run into any FPS issues either, so that’s a big plus. It does make my gaming laptop quite hot though (around 80°C).+ The dash (or dodge mechanic) has iframes that are fairly forgiving, but timing is necessary. There’s no stamina bar limiting you from dashing as much as you want, and you can use your wire to teleport to enemies or pull them to you.+ The camera angle and distance are good. No issues with the targeting system either. I get motion sickness easily, but I haven't felt sick while playing this game.+ For the upgrades and weapons, I can’t talk about that in-depth as I’m still at the beginning. However, the combat which is the core of the game flows smoothly due to responsive controls and the combos feel pretty good.- My only gripe is that there doesn’t seem to be a feature to rebind keys. I’d like to be able to remap my keys.- Can't say I care for the narrative, but I'm only playing it for the hack and slash element anyway, so that's for you to judge.Final thoughts: It’s a solid action game with a reasonable price tag to it.

Having beta tested this game since March, I was able to see the finished product morph into what it is at release.  I must say, for those that are in the fence about buying the game, just get it.  I spent nearly 50 hours alone in testing various maps and aspects of the game and not once did I ever get bored.In regards to gameplay, the core loop is deploying your forces, capturing the key victory points, and then reinforcing and resupplying your forces.  With this in mind, there are many different aspects that must be considered when attacking and defending.  Different stats such as scatter, range, hard attack, soft attack, defense of both types, supply, and more all must be taken into account.  There are multiple types of each unit, each having their own personal stats.  For example, a Panzer 35t vs a Panzer 38t are both tanks but each have a slightly different set of stats, despite being nearly identical.  In addition, they also cost slightly different amounts of influence, which is the games primary resource for buying units and resupplying them.I could go on forever about all of the different aspects of units but I'd be here forever.  In addition to the above, there are a ton of maps available.  Each campaign map can end in different ways.  Major victory, minor victory, major loss, and minor loss.  These end results dictate which map you get next assuming there is one.  For example, failing certain maps can end the entire campaign and force you to restart that map while others may detour your into different non-historical routes, like having Franco help and join the Axis in Spain.In the graphics and sound department, you get your typical indie developer assets here.  The unit models themselves are detailed and you can definitely see the difference from a Panzer III H and a Panzer III J.  Barrel lengths are changed to accomodate which tanks or units you are using.  The sound track is probably the most generalized portion of the game.  Meaning, it isn't anything outstanding but isn't anything bad either.  In the end, for a small development team, they are pretty damn decent.Now, for those of you who are new to this genre of game.  I highly recommend asking for help or using some of the older YouTube videos for how to play along with the tooltips that you can enable in game.  This isn't something you can just pick up and play without getting beat down.  There are different things that need to be taken into account, some of which I already discussed.  Supply, supply routes by rail, water, and air.  Terrain and whether or not it is also raining, causing mud and slowing things down.  Rain itself will ground planes and any expensive air resupply attempts.  Generals and commanders along with the units get abilities and traits as they continue to level and gain experience.  Additionally, some generals can have flaws that you can remove over time as you get more influence and victory points.  Keeping this review somewhat short, I'll say this.  It is an excellent successor to the Panzer General games.  For a small team that has had its own setbacks, they did a fantastic job and producing a solid product here.  Despite having some positive bias, what you are getting here is every bit worth the 40 dollars being asked.

It is much more fast paced and goofy (especially in voice) but has less strategic elements the original TOS had. Long version: The game has many fun or overpowered roles with a few weaker/boring ones but they're outshined by a mile. The background designs and map are in 2.5D, and are visually ok, a combination of old TOS and some fantasy cartoony stuff (I hope more maps are added in the future however).The voice mode for traitors in salem is integrated seamlessly and actually fills in a niche that TOS was lacking (since text is a disadvantage alot of the time). Proximity chat exists and is pretty good however there needs to be individual sound bars for each player (some are loud af and some are 10 miles away from their mic). I have encountered very few bugs such as dc'ing mid lynch or game and then joining a new one can cause a weird glitch where all the game UI is messed up and you can phase. Few Pros:More roles than other Among us like games (and more roles than TOS?)Lots of variation and customisation in games (However classic mode can become stale overtime with the same people)Fun with strangers due to the voice chat optionFor me currency has been seemingly easy to get (without paying irl money)Few Cons: Sometimes the FPS can be dodgy but I haven't felt it much'Vents' are wayyy more risky imo (not actually a bad thing depending on your stance)The 'cameras' aka telescopes are pretty strong...no indication your being watched UI can feel clunky and slow at times (and the noise is hella loud especially for being lynched)Needs:TutorialA friend's list/way to add peopleIndividual player volume optionsMaybe a proper dead chat to type in 24/7 while a ghost?More task variation (not same 3 ones)More gamemodes or some more traitor variation in the classic listJailor."}, {"username": "Necrie", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "An extremely fun deception game with a variety of fun roles and gorgeous designs set in a 2.5d world. You can tell that much work have gone into making an enjoyable experience. If you enjoyed playing games such as Town of salem, Among Us, Project Winter or Dread Hunger.. you are bound to love this game.Will update the review according with how the beta test has been going, stating pros and cons. But the alpha test was a mostly clean experience. Beta Test Edit #1: Just tried the voice and text mode for traitors in salem. Voice recognition is mostly seamless and they also include proximity voice chat for when you are ingame. However one thing I recommend is being able to tell who is speaking more easily when you are in discussion phase by lighting up their entire row rather than just the circle with the avatar in it. Regarding how smooth the game plays with public, I have not yet to encounter many bugs (with the exception of clipping, but not something you can do by accident at all.) Played a mix of town and traitor roles, all roles I played seem to work without problems and seem mostly balanced for now with the exception of cultist when paired with other traitors. One suggestion currently is to add a proper friendlist for the game, something that I feel should of been there on release.Beta Test Edit #2: As the game is still in early beta, i have come across a number of glitches with the games engine and a few disconnecting issues. My internet is fully stable but seems some certain actions cause you to disconnect. Please keep this in mind when trying to play the game. The game has been mostly bug free until this issue with disconnecting. Keep in mind that this game is in early access and is not perfect, but i've found myself still having alot of fun otherwise.

Isn't this just a blatant rip off of Among Us? Well, let me bring up a few notes before getting into the actual review section. First off, Among Us could be argued to be a copy of Town of Salem which is from the developers of this game. Second off, there are many games styled similarly but have different aspects than Among Us, like Project Winter, Goose Goose Duck, and plenty of others. This is one of those games. Before you judge it I would suggest you at least try the game before doing so!Now onto my actual thoughts of the game itself. BlankMediaGames have really outdone themselves with the Alpha process of the game. With 31 unique roles all resembling their former Town of Salem roles, many returning characters with skins as well, and built in Proximity Chat, the doors that this game have are endless. Originally going into it, I was thinking two things, one that of course, the trailer and reveals make it look almost identical to Among Us because it was a pre-alpha build that was shown, and two that it had lots of potential to become something significantly better than Among Us. Many of the improvements and additions have been a result of the devs taking feedback from the community. I know I probably had a big part in getting proximity chat because that's the only thing I would tell Traitor Rus (one of the game developers) to do!Aside from the 31 unique roles, Traitors in Salem also has Traitor Spells which differ from the reactor and O2 limited Among Us impostor abilities. There's also the addition of Boons which give you a temporary or permanent buff for the entirety of that game. On top of a vast map, there are many ways you can fast travel between different points of the map other than just your feet. The map is also dynamic in the sense that traitors can cut off certain routes from being able to be used!In the few months I created content for and saw this game grow and take advise from the community which is something that is rarely seen from many developers, you can really only make up your mind once you play it. No matter how much the game costs, it is well worth it and suits many different play styles (VC on vs off), being probably the best quick way to burn a solid 5-10 minutes of your time while also having fun. Plus, as it's an early access game, you know that there is so much more content in the works behind the scenes that will just add to your investment as time goes on. Here's to a big launch! You should definitely get it, the game is great. - ShadowDior"}, {"username": "Brazil", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "The negative reviews nearly made me pass on this but I'm glad I just decided to just try it myself.

I honestly think you could make a diablo style campaign with these mechanics and I wouldn't have any problem playing through it with these gameplay mechanics alone. I really feel like the only thing that would be able to hold this game back would be a lack of content, as in bosses, enemies, tilesets and so on, but as I've played way to little to comment on that I'll update my review when I know more. It's also incredibly important to note that this game is CHEAP, so even if there does not turn out to be a whole lot of content the game is well worth it, 8€ for this amount of polish and character is insane.Now onto my few gripes from playing an extremely short amount of time, these might be addressed by playing the game more or mechanics I have not yet discovered so please take these with a grain of salt, I do hope the developers reads this though.- Boss/Miniboss Health seems really really high, this might be due to me just having started the game but I really think this is quite bad for a roguelite. Feeling like battles are determined by skill and not attrition is what makes roguelikes addictive in my opinion, having bulletsponges in roguelikes is really REALLY boring in my opinion. This is after the tutorial mind you, I am not talking about the first tutorial boss I am talking about the named \"minibosses\" that are in some levels.- Stunlock is also not a fun mechanic, there might be a way to get out these and there probably is when I've unlocked more scrolls but I feel it's important to note. It feels like if I get hit by the first hit in a 3 hit combo I need to stay there for all three, might get fixed later, still not a fun mechanic regardless, I would love to be able to dash out of these if atleast my reactions are good.- Being able to retreat feels really lame, I think you should aim at designing encounters that feel fair, giving the player the ability to retreat just feels like a bandaid for some encounters being unfair. I am NOT telling you to make the game easy but if you make me be able to win each encounter without trying to kill a bulletsponge for 5 minutes with really low damage I don't need to be able to retreat.

Super floaty and there's no weight behind your attacks. Every attack ends in a long recovery idle that makes even the most basic attacks/combos feel clunky.Bosses \"guard\" all normal attacks, so you have to time your move to when they are about to attack, but it doesn't stagger them or anything, and every time they hit you, you're going to get stunned for 10 seconds.You cannot aim with your mouse, which I would greatly prefer to a controller.If that description doesn't turn you away, and you liked what you saw on the trailer you will like it.But for me it's a 2/5."}, {"username": "Timrod", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Samurai Bringer is a pretty good action-roguelike.. with some very weird issues. The core game is fine, it's just that there were a lot of really odd balancing decisions that don't make a lot of sense.The game revolves around assigning different attacks to \"barrages\", which can then be assigned to a button. Barrages can be chained into combos, which run on a stamina bar. There's a lot of experimentation involved, which is sometimes rewarded and sometimes not.An example of the former are the secret move combos that most weapons have, which usually come with a unique animation. One I found early on was that if you equip two swords and have your barrages set up to be alternating horizontal slashes (left to right, right to left) combined with four points of jump skills, you get a move that more or less turns your character into a flying blender.The latter are far more common. The best example of this I can think of is the Wave ability, which fires a projectile from your weapon when swung. While most skills don't care whether you're doing a \"light\" or \"heavy\" attack, Wave only works with specific heavy attack setups.. but the game will happily allow you to equip it in a spot where it does nothing but waste stamina. The only time the game will ever stop you is if you have a completely incompatible moveset - something like trying to use gun attacks on a sword.Now we get to the bad parts. There's no easy way to quickly switch up your barrages - which is a problem when you're trying to use a gun (which certain enemies are immune to for no apparent reason) or trying to switch up elemental skills to hit weaknesses or avoid immunities. You can unlock the ability to have pre-set barrages you can switch to with one button, but given that there's five elements (Fire, Ice, Storm, Lightning, Evil) there's no way to buy enough to be able to quick-switch all of your barrages over. You also have to find a specific building during your run to switch up your pre-set combos.There's also the very strange balance decision to make certain enemies (notably some of the eight bosses you have to defeat to finish the game) completely immune to ranged attacks, which renders the gun and bow kind of useless compared to melee weapons, which nothing is immune to. Despite all of this, Samurai Bringer isn't a bad game, though I would recommend looking up a guide to figure out how all of the skills work - since again, a lot of it isn't documented in the game anywhere."}]}, {"game_id": "1582680", "game_title": "Trolley_Problem_Inc", "discount_original_price": "$10.99", "discount_price": "$9.89", "overall_score": "Mixed", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Choices Matter", "Indie", "Dark Humor", "Life Sim", "Casual", "Simulation", "Immersive Sim", "Minimalist", "Text-Based", "Artificial Intelligence", "Capitalism", "Comedy", "Education", "Funny", "Philosophical", "Singleplayer", "Satire", "Surreal", "Underground", "Co-op"], "reviews": [{"username": "AvoPlus", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Some of the situations seem to want to trap you and others are so ludicrous that it feels like even for a $10 game they could have spent some more time thinking of something more clever."}, {"username": "Kaichō Akron", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Unlike really anything I've played before, Trolley Problem Inc. is a great game for people interested in philosophical dilemmas.At it's core, it's a big collection of difficult questions played out through a narrative (featuring a well-spoken narrator questioning every decision you make) which goes from classic trolley problems, to bigger scale issues, and even some very abstract problems.The game is a little on the short side (the solo campaign is beatable in about an hour) but it's also pretty fun to play with friends and significant others on subsequent play-throughs.

It's slow-paced and requires a lot of saving, even to the point where you'll probably save before every door, 'cause you just don't know what's on the other side that will totally wreck your party, or accidentally buy something expensive just to find out the character can't use it, and even the death of a party member can quickly drain your resources.If you can endure, you will smile and you will rage, but you will feel that you were the hero of an epic adventure."}, {"username": "rrdy68", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "My original thoughts on this version was wrong.

When you modify your characters scroll down the stats and use the left and right arrow keys to increase or decrease the number.

In each game of the Saga, you can transfer your characters from a previous game making it out to be one epic adventure. In addition to the Pools Saga, there are the 2 classics of the Savage Frontier. In Frontier games you will find the first time in the history of PC gaming NPCs that could interact with meaningfully, even the first time you could have a romance. The final game in this volume, Unlimited Adventures, is for those that really enjoy the game engine. It allows you to make your own games. The negative in all this is that the modern gamer will hate this game. I would never have got it myself if it did not come with an auto mapper and the app that made it more playable. The app allows you to access logs, journals, and hints if you need them. Back in the day, most of this took a lot of work and most of the time you did your own mapping. What remains a nightmare for me is the loot management. For instance, after each battle you must decide what to do with the loot, where it goes, who will take it, and all through a series of changing inventory screens. This is simply no fun and takes up a great deal of the game. The combat is also no fun and its pretty dull in terms of the modern turn-based games out there. Thankfully, there is a quick option that allows for an auto battle.

With 10h played internally it shows 30% of the game has been completedMore info below....https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787493353THE LOWDOWN:For the complete lowdown and more info see the: Full ReviewANALYSIS:F:ETF was overall a treat to play. Some aspects were better than my original impressions. Others were a little lacklustre. Combat in particular can be satisfying with the right combos of inventory and enough sword cards but less when these do not materialise. A common theme depending on the syngergisation strategy the hero becomes dependent on, given their circumstances.AMBIENCE & AESTHETICS+ MUSICAL SCORE- SUPPORTING AUDIO* VISUALSF:ETF delivers a visual experience of pixelated art, that is quite sharp and grew on me as I spent time with the game. Heroes, monsters, items and locations are all recognisable if basic in appearance. Gamers that aren't fond of pixel graphics wont like what's on offer here. The delicate musical score added an adventuring vibe about and was surprisingly pretty good for a game with this level of budget game.MECHANICS+ CARDS+ STATUSES+ CORRUPTION- NO LEVELLING- COMBAT- UNIQUE ABILITIESThere is a good but small core of game mechanics that allow for a varied dungeon-crawling experience. The mix of card types, inventory items, [&] corrupted items, hero setups and the challenge mode in particular, make for a wide-casted net of possible strategy. All of this tied in with the tactical need to keep the hero alive at it moves from one card to another. Combat takes some getting used to due to being unclear when a card will emit damage to nearby enemies. With no weapon to upgrade over time, this could be a lost opportunity to introduce a little more roleplaying into the game, with equippable items. The use of stealth to avoid confrontations is great but under utilised by a lack of cards. One that seems dependent on the hero being played.Overall mechanics are quite good however with no levelling included the only way of bettering a character is to collect more max. health cards. No option is provided to do the same in parallel for armour. Perhaps even having mana as a pool, rather than a threshold resource that activates powers, would have been a better bet. Allowing these to cast numerous times when in a sticky situation. Essentially having these as stats that can be increased over time like health.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787940273CORE GAMEPLAY+ CHARACTERS* DUNGEON CRAWLING* LEVEL BOSSES + DYNAMIC DUNGEONS+ MINI-LOCATIONS* ADVENTURING* LAYOUTF:ETF very much plays like a solitaire card game but with the guise of an adventuring dungeon-crawler. Its action may be fast paced but there is a decent depth of strategy presented in its challenge. While choosing the route to navigate through a dungeon level may seem like the game's core decision making component, synergising items held in a character's inventory is the key to succeeding.The inclusion of abstracted locations may seem obvious but increase the game's immersion into being one of a dungeon crawler. In particular F:ETF combines its components to deliver an experience may seem simple but sets up an impressive framework to deliver a dynamic challenge not only through the randomisation and deployment of cards but the items that become available throughout a dungeon. ACCESSIBILITY+ TUTORIAL- GUI- SAVE SLOTSWith an intuitive interface F:TEF is a game that is very easy to pick-up and play. After all we will or will have played standard solitaire at some point in our lives. If per chance you have not, then the limited mechanics the game has will be explained in the very short tutorial.COMPLEXITY+ GAME MODES - ROGUE-LIKE RESTARTSWith such a simple design, gameplay is very a straight-forward beast. The two difficulty modes allow players to perfect their strategies and then turn their hand to a more challenging experience. The Challenge mode provides a twist by placing preset restrictions but the Journey mode that allows players to customise the difficulty to their preference. Perfect for casual or hardcore players. The depth to the game really is within the possible synergies.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787940439REPLAYABILITY & LONGEVITY+ CARD DRAWS + UNLOCK HEROES * LEADERBOARDS The core game-loop is designed for fast paced encounters games which are short. Their fixed length also keeps game time narrow. Therefore players will be repeating what is essentially the same core gameplay, over and over. The current modes only slight variation but at least the dynamic nature of the dungeons ensure some differences of experience. Character unlocks only extend gameplay so far.The Challenge mode was a pretty good variant and I would like to see this expanded, so that players are forced to take x good and y corrupted items of their choice. I am disappointed not to see an Infinite mode that would enable players to see how many levels they could take their character through before succumbing to their wounds. Possibly even adding a speed-mode.QUALITY+ ROAD MAP - MINIMAL SETTINGS * POLISHED F:ETF maybe a low budget game by appearance but its elegant design sure does make for some quality entertainment. The soundtrack is another positive  and while pixelated art isn't my greatest joy, it is well-made here. Apart from the lack of Steam integration the negatives to speak of are few and some of those are scheduled to be looked at.VERDICT:F:ETF is a simple, yet solidly well-made game with an addictive quality. Fans of casual and fast-paced games with subtle strategies that rely on synergisation should find something that appeals. Especially fans of solitaire card and dungeon-crawler, which are combined here.Additional content would add variety and an infinite mode would be most welcome. Despite the limited number of possible synergisations, it is WORTHWHILE to play.Thank you for reading. | Follow my curator here. | Key provided by Turn-Based Tactics"}, {"username": "t('-'t) PiP", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "It's fun, has a lot of potential, but there's no challenge and the game ends quickly.

Clerics never learn healing spells or resurrections other than Cure Minor Wounds, while Druids get Cure Serious Wounds, and Cure Critical Wounds, as well as the Raise Dead spell. Clerics are seriously under powered/low-utility.Wake of the Ravager Tips (adding as I play through):- Left shift key skips the opening videos- The default Half-Giant gladiator character (Gerakis) starts with a special weapon, so start with him and transfer the weapon over and drop/add a new character in his place if you want the weapon but not the character.

It makes up for its shortcomings by offering a great story and a new, innovative setting, sort of a fantasy Mad Max / Roman Empire mix. Unusual races such as Mantis-Women (Thri-Kreen), which are usually the bad guys in AD&D games, half-giants and half-dwarves are new playable races - and my first party I played through consisted of 4 mantissisis... you get it.Apart from the usual AD&D classes of the time (fighter, ranger, cleric, mage, thief) DARK SUN adds gladiator (variation of the barbarian), druid and psionicist, the latter coming with an entire spellbook of their own and three (!) disciplines. That's a lot of spells! The spells alone take up over 30 pages of the manual.Combat is tactical and unlike the earlier Gold Box games it does not switch screens for combat - the entire game is played from an isometric point of view.The controls are a bit wonky, especially during combat the distance between the sprites is not always clear, and sometimes friend and foe are indistinguishable (especially when it's Thri-Kreen against Thri-Kreen). This is even worse in the sequel, WAKE OF THE RAVAGER, which came out exactly a year later but manages to look much worse than SHATTERED LANDS did.

I've only played for around 100 minutes as of writing and I am already in love. However it does need some re-balancing. Now to be fair, I wrote this on the day it came out, so obviously there are gonna be some balance issues. I'm just gonna list about things I noticed:Conquest Mode: This is the main mode of the game, where you invade sectors across 4 islands and conquer the enemy base at the end. It has a cool risk and reward system where the more sectors you invade, the more units and abilities you get, however the stronger the enemy becomes. The only thing I have to say about this game mode is that it needs difficulty descriptions for the sectors, as some battles will be harder than others and you can't really tell.Endless Mode: Pretty obvious here, you pick whatever units you want and survive as long as possible against an enemy that's getting more and more difficult as it progresses, I didn't really find many issues with it, but I wasn't really too interested either.Random Battle: This is honestly my favorite mode. you spawn with varied (i would say random but I think some units are always added no matter what for fairness) units and try and defeat the enemy AI. Its nice for trying out new units and is also nice as you don't have full control over your starting units. I think the AI do need to be updated, as each difficulty seems rather easy to beat no matter which you select.Balance issues:your regular standard grunt unit has a grenade launcher that can nearly insta-kill basic enemy units (I should note now this game has no multiplayer and some of the AI's units are different than yours) - To fix this, maybe make it a tier 1 upgrade, as to be fair, they only get 1 shot, they can miss it, and it is useful for enemy defenses and vehicles.you can spawn 3 support units, and I believe their buffs might stack, which is pretty unfair, plus they have an artillery attack and having 3 of them at once using it seems a lil unfair.you can spawn 3 snipers who will sit FAR from the enemy and just pick them off without destroying the enemy base. they do insta-kills on infantry so you could essentially just grind with them, or spawn a single unit and just push with them while the snipers cover, and the snipers get a HUGE range boost when you use the hold button, making them even more unfair - my idea for this is to just make it so you can only spawn one, they can only push a little forward, and are more defensive type unitsthe shield units can be spawned in 3s and are really useful when the enemy has a lot of infantry or snipers, but i think their health should be reduced some.you can spam turrets with enough funds in clustered groups.units don't need to recharge which means as soon as one dies, you can instantly spawn another, which is fine for weaker units, but is really unfair for your tougher units, plus some units have abilities to spawn more units that don't add to your unit limit/supply/whatever its called.other than that and some other issues I probably don't know about, the game is fun and is a good way to waste time, plus it has no micro transactions, which also a plus in my bookIdeas I have:More unitsmore mapsdifferent themed enemies (aesthetics mostly, but having different themed enemies with their own custom units would be cool as well)more unit customization, maybe different base designs or unit outfits, or anything along those lines.Different types of battles. This might need some explanation. I noticed that based on difficulty, the enemy will have a different base designs each time. I think these bases having their own abilities would be cool, for example, there is an enemy base that is basically a big friggen missile on the back of a truck. maybe you need to destroy the truck before time runs out, or maybe a base that has turrets and can defend itself. Stuff like that.TL;DR the game is fun and a good time waster. It needs some balance patches for cheesy strats against the AI, but other than that I recommend this game absolutelyPS: all the songs in this game are absolute bangersEdit:  Some clarity, the cheesy strats I was talking about were in random battles. The main gamemode is a lot different since you have finite units and abilities and can choose which units to bring into battles, while random battles give you obviously random units. I also didn't play the main gamemode on its hardest difficulty, which i definitely should have, so both of those errors are on me. I have now played on harder difficulties and can say that the game does have challenge.

I want to call it a \"lazy strategy\" in the best way possible. You can take as much time as necessary to prepare for your missions and plan them out, and even on the field, there's ample time to understand your next move at every step. Units seem to have clear counters and strengths, upgrade progression feels nice, it feels well balanced all around.One of my favourite things about Warpips so far is, I never feel like I have to think about too much at once. I can enjoy the chaos, without straining my brain to the point that I can no longer focus on anything aesthetic at all {looking at you, Starcraft}. The fact that there is very little micro-management in this game means the player is truly in more of a \"commander\" seat, rather than an all-controlling god. You just say what your army should look like, and when they should move, but they'll figure out the details themselves. Your main job tends to be appreciating the hilarious pixel-art mayhem that ensues after dropping hundreds of dollars on expensive war equipment.I would really just love to see more content for the game. More units, upgrades, abilities, maps and map types, multiplayer co-op and PvP, other game modes, almost anything honestly.

Annoying as ♥♥♥♥.-Not much depth to the gameplay, it's all about clicking units as soon as they're available (There are some units that  counter certain other units, but most of the time you won't have them because, you guessed it, they expired the battle before.)-No PvP (Yet, hopefully)-Battles are repetitive, but not in a good roguelike way, as this game has no randomness(events/encounters) to justify it.For 4,80€ during sales?

I bought this game for about 3-4 euros with a \"meh, let's try it\" attitude.The developer is doing themselves a disservice! If they classified, correctly, their game as resource production, management game they could legitimately charge 10-12  euros for it. The fact that you have numbers going up is irrelevant. Numbers go up also in the storage containers of Satisfactory. This is simply, the best distilled, resource and production chain management game in steam now.

The game mechanics are simple since all you do is move blocks of the same color until you form a line. It gets more difficult as you progress, but they become as easy as the first few puzzles whenever a new color is introduced. In the end, the game was so easy I only had trouble finishing 5 puzzles out of the 36 it had.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2799171969Some puzzle games like Yokai Secret add a bit of plot to spice things up, but this game isn't one of those. Sure, each of the girls says some lines here and there, but you don't miss anything if you ignore them.The devs put a lot of work into the art, and it shows. The characters are beautiful, and the minimalistic design of the puzzles meshes well with the more elaborate backgrounds. The sex scenes are fine too, but they are unlocked right after installing the 18+ patch, and thus you are less motivated to finish the game.Overall, I recommend you to purchase this game if you're a fan of the genre and the game is on sale. It could have been worth its price if they made the puzzles a bit harder or, at least, not so easy you finish the game in no more than 30 minutes.This review has been brought to you by the Lewd Games Reviewers.

You eventually come to the conclusion that these images, mere drawings can give you a stronger erection than any real girl you've ever seen on some dreadful erotic video-sharing site. Fact of the matter is, why do we even need real women when an overworked 35-year old Japanese artist using nothing but a drawing tablet and their brain, can create the ideal depiction of a woman.This simply isn't a game anymore, it's become a lifestyle.

I ignored the instructions and didn't realize I could crouch so I missed seeing a key to unlock a door. However, despite my confusion, the game is decently fun. It is extremely short (even with my confusion, I still completed a run in less than an hour), and I'm sure for those that are good at games, it will take only 10-20 minutes for a complete run. I do like the sounds in-game, they're not too obnoxious or loud. I love the graphics and am a fan of the VHS-inspired graphics. The game does allow for changing the VHS intensity but I didn't really see that much of a difference (but I also only messed around with it in the menu). There isn't much of a story--a coworker mentions some disappearances and your boss sends you on an errand to the parking garage. There isn't really much of a reason behind why Lamphead exists (is he in the package you're sent to collect?). The ending was surprisingly pretty good for such a vague storyline. One of the first issues I have with the game is that it offers a window mode but with no option to change the resolution. For my laptop, the game's \"window\" mode is still the same size as fullscreen. If you move or press any other button besides E, the dialogue ends and you'll have to restart the entire dialogue from the beginning again (not a big deal but I do like exploring games and reading NPC dialogues). The game does need some more proofreading, since there are some grammar errors (such as \"What are you doing standing in there\" when talking to some coworkers). Pressing ESC pulls up a menu but it doesn't actually pause the game. As for the bugs in the game, I only found a couple during my playthroughs. Lamphead can and DOES see you through the wall if you unscrew the vent when he's walking in the hallway by the bathroom door. I also had Lamphead see me right as I was unlocking the HR office and he had followed me into the office but stayed in the front area of the room. I was able to grab the gun and shoot him but it didn't harm him. He eventually turned around and left, walking through the now closed door. For achievement hunters, I had some issues with two achievements not popping (tongue-tied and blabby), which required a few attempts before they popped).Overall, I did enjoy this game. I don't really see much replay value in the game as there's only one ending and the game is extremely short once you figure out what to do and how to go undetected from Lamphead.
