Classic LEGO humour, characters and updated gameplay mechanics. Definitely hits you with a wave of nostalgia, but Skywalker Saga is reinvented beautifully and contains the best of both worlds, retaining the classic feel while also adding new additions. Awesome game if you just don't want something too serious to play or need to blow off steam.Recommended 10/10"}, {"username": "N-V US", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "100%'d the game so I've done every scripted thing you can do and what can I say about this.Well for fans who wanted a LEGO Star Wars game as good as TCS since it came out, this is the answer you're looking for. It's humor and zany cutscenes have devolved since the older games, but the tradeoff is a complete rework including redone levels, an excellent combat system and an expansive galaxy that has a decently immersive effect.First, the Story: The story does a more accurate job of retelling the saga with tons of decent voiceacting (you can turn off voice acting with mumble mode to have an older LEGO experience. I will say though, mumble mode isn't single mumbles, they mumble out entire sentences, so it feels a little weird), the cutscenes work with or without voiceacting which is a surreal dynamic experience that the devs get my kudos on, but the levels themselves are really short and kind've disappointing. They introduce \"level challenges\", there are 3 in every level and they're alternative ways of going about each one. They're fun in general, but if you're trying to 100% they can be a nightmare sometimes. Minikits have been reduced from 10 to 5 per level, which was debatably my favorite part about replaying a level. Overall, cutscene and immersion-wise, the levels are fun to play and have the same great puzzle-solving they've always had, replayability is quite low though.First-Time through 9/10Free-Play 100% 6/10 (basically, thank god they're short)Now Galaxy-Mode was easily the most fun I've had through the whole experience. Instead of collecting gold bricks to a grand total of 250, (using the Marvel Avengers game as the mold here since it's the last one I 100%'d, god it sucked), there are 1,160 bricks, (known as \"kyber bricks\") that are collectable through completing level challenges, collecting minikits, getting \"true jedi\" on each level, doing side quests among 33 planets, destroying kyber comets, smuggling, doing bounty hunts, and puzzles on each and every planet. It was a ton of fun to mark each planet off the list as I collected each planets' worth. Some quests can only be done if you've progressed through the story up until that point, or until you've done other side quests. Personally, I recommend playing the base game all the way through 4-6, 1-3, 7-9, THEN doing galaxy-mode, so there will be less holdups. In advance, there was only 1 planet that gave me trouble and it was Endor, my guess is, the fire VFX would keep spawning as you laoded new areas, and it wouldn't unload areas your're not in anymore so the constant fire VFX made it a laggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Other than that, the quests and puzzles are really fun to complete.9/10, it is the after-story experience you want.I'll wrap it up here with the UI, combat/upgrade system, and the red bricks rework.So the Ui for the most part is pretty straightforward, might take a bit of learning but once you have it down, it all makes sense, stuff goes where it should go, changing characters is a bit messy and if you have OCD about how you want your free-play characters organized, that might be a huge problem because thats the only place where the UI falters heavily. Once you play, you'll figure out what I mean.The combat system is EXTREMELY intricate, you have a third person firing mode with guns and saber-throwing. There's also cover you can hide behind (and rebuild if it gets destroyed) and shoot from if you want to play that way. The biggest highlight though is the melee combat system. You initiate combat with a standard attack which can then go into changeups like heavy attacks, uppercut moves, and spike moves, depending on which corresponding button you press. These changeups become extremely prevalent in the lightsaber boss duels which make you feel like you control how the corresponding movie-scene flows.The red brick rework has been made easier to manage and deal with, you don't collect red bricks, instead you collect \"Data cards\" (1 per particular planet) in galaxy mode. They aren't specific to certain extras, you get the data card and choose which extra you want. (I recommend not buying anything until you get your first data card and do the stud multiplier route, things are hella expensive this time around so I'd say focus on getting all multipliers before you buy anything else) That being said \"Stud magnet\" and \"Fast build\" aren't extras anymore, they're \"Upgrades\"The upgrade system integrates things like collecting studs, building faster, sprinting quicker, having more health, doing more damage, etc. which is where kyber bricks come in, as they are used as it's currency, plus an additional stud fee. (Now this is the exception to my advice about \"not buying anything\", buy upgrades when you can) There are core upgrades and class upgrades for specific character types, (Jedi, Hero, Bounty Hunter, Scoundrel, Scavenger, Villain, Dark Side, Astromech Droids, Protocol Droids, and Extras.) all of which have their own abilities and uses.All of these features really make the experience flow a lot smoother and are a perfect 10/10 for me.TL;DR: buy the game if you've been wanting a decent Lego Star Wars game, things are different for the better, mumble mode is there, and if you get deluxe, you get classic character packs (if nostalgia is your thing) among other misc. character packs. red bricks have been changed into a more easily flowing system, and the combat = good.Big word of advice: once you're in galaxy mode, buy the rumor for the character \"Grummgar\", complete all the missions to get him and you get to run really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fast around some of these bigger planets to complete your side quests."}, {"username": "Raxanio", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Game breaking bug in Episode VII when talking to Maz Kanata. Review will stay negative till fixed."}, {"username": "RazorShader", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Because of some disappointments in the past, I generally try not to be hyped by new games anymore. Nevertheless, this game gathered my attention and being the cheapskate that I am, I planned to keep an eye on it and buy it at a sale. But I saw some content in which the game looked really fun and properly polished, so I decided to treat myself on the deluxe edition. Initially the game was fun despite a bunch of flaws (by which I mean both glitches and more subjective flaws based on my personal opinion); fun enough for me to still wholeheartedly recommend it. But at some point the negative started to outweigh the positive, so I guess I will only recommend this game when enough of the issues are addressed. Because of many of the glitches and clunkily implemented features, I doubt the game has been properly playtested. I heard the game was delayed on various occasions because of the difficulties with implementing the open world aspects, but it seems that at some point they gave up and released the unfinished product anyway. Since I bought the deluxe edition, I would assume I wouldn’t have to feel like playing a pre-release betatester and that a developer would have the decency to complete a game before releasing additional content to rake in more money. TT games isn’t the only one to execute ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practices like this (having some Cyberpunk 2077 vibes here), but it sure sucks it seems to become the standard. Here is a list of things I specifically like and things I don’t.Positive aspects• The game allows you to explore the galaxy a lot. In many areas you’re not constrained by objectives you have to progress because you’re in a mission, so you can help people on side missions, solve puzzles to get collectibles and just roam around and have some fun.• The dialogues are really fun. In the trailer I saw for the game, many of the jokes fell flat (for me), but in context they were much more fun. There are many jokes referencing the movies (and quotes referenced in memes), which I expect many to enjoy. A protocol droid next to the Tusken village, for example, will tell you it’s “home of not just the men, but the women and children too”. Characters selected can also have some interaction; Vader will tell Palpatine he already heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise countless times. • Visually it generally looks very nice, with much of attention to detail, especially when it comes to the figures. The capes look like actual fabric, and the figures themselves even have lines from the molds and a real plastic-looking shine.• Flying freely in space in combat is very smooth, at least it is with mouse and keyboard. For me it fits perfectly between the classic and new Battlefront II, meaning it’s both easy to steer to fly and to aim to shoot. On a controller, I found steering much harder, but that’s probably also the result of me being less used to controllers.Negative aspects• It’s not always clear where freeplay starts and ends. You can complete story related objectives in the open world parts, but it’s not clear when you can and can’t select other characters to complete puzzles that require a certain type of character.• The missions that don’t take place in the open world are very short. Especially when replaying them it felt glaringly obvious how less content there is in this regard. The Sarlacc/sail barge mission, for example, has a small portion that immediately starts on deck with Luke and Lando and then cuts to a boss fight against Jabba with Leia and R2-D2. It was fun to actually fight Jabba in person, but the whole mission was very short compared to the skiff hopping and below deck objectives of Lego Star Wars II.• There is a reason I spoke about “flying freely in space combat” before, and that is that in a bunch of missions, you can’t fly freely. It really makes it feel like you’re stuck on a monorail with limited space to move. In the Naboo submarine mission this felt somewhat logical, but for others (the Millenium Falcon asteroid chase and the Death Star I trench run) it felt really limiting and annoying. In missions such as the Jango Fett Geonosis chase and the Naboo Trade Federation control ship battle you’re allowed to move much more freely, making these missions much more enjoyable.• This monorail feeling also applies to many of the boss fights, portions of which you will be locked onto the boss without being able to unlock again (locking onto bosses in games can be useful, but it’s better if you can lock onto the boss yourself and disable it again as well). The game also heavily relies on quicktime events during these boss fights, which really removes a sense of urgency and personal skill when battling them. And unfortunately, these quicktime events regularly take some time to be triggered. When battling Dooku, at some point he just kept taking a beating with the same amount of barely any health, and after my 300 combo he required multiple seconds to walk to the right place to trigger the final quicktime event.• Many interesting potential missions are relegated to cutscenes, which is very unfortunate. You get to enter Palpatine’s office to arrest him as Windu and Fisto, but not to fight him, and space/vehicle battles such as the battle of Coruscant, battle of Geonosis and the Death Star II battle are just there as cutscenes. • There are various missions causing massive framerate drops without any ‘visual justification’ to back it up. The Geonosis factory and Ewok village don’t look better than most other places, so they shouldn’t cause such low framerates.• Once a mission is started, you can’t leave it without completing it (or so it seems).• The main menu animation can’t be skipped, so you’ll have to sit through Rey’s “I need someone to show me my place in all this” and the slow zoom out every time you want to load a savegame or leave the game altogether. And as a player, you’re not allowed to show her her place in all that, which definitely is not in the center above all other characters. Jarring. • The intro animation skip also doesn’t work properly; it says you need to hold F to skip it, but you first need to tap a key (either F or another one) first. • The character selection menu isn’t user friendly. There’s a lot of character classes with specific characters, and you can’t navigate the menus with your mouse.  • The game doesn’t always seem to properly apply the character you selected. Not the one you picked altogether sometimes (because it seems to think you selected it already, although you’re obviously not that character), but also not the specific version of that character you selected. In many instances, this game just doesn’t seem to want me to play as the stormtrooper commander with the spooling gun, so I’ll keep ending up with the regular one with the regular blaster.• Even when in freeplay, it’s sometimes impossible to switch characters from your preselected ones, so you’ll have to switch with the character next to you first.• The game also seems to have a hard time remembering which characters you had selected when entering/leaving a room. And switching to the one you’re not isn’t always possible because the game seems to think you’re already that character while you’re not.• The rotating mini-map (if you select the option) forgets to rotate a lot. You can make it rotate again by switching with the character next to you (and back), but it sucks I have to keep doing it every single time I enter another area.• Enemies are sparse in numbers when compared to the large amounts of the earlier Lego Star Wars games and are unlikely to kill you. Characters with activated lightsabers will automatically reflect blaster bolts without requiring the need to hold a block button. You’re much more likely to die because of one of the next few bulletpoints.[REST OF THE REVIEW IN THE COMMENTS]"}, {"username": "RatzMouze", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "This game has so many game-breaking bugs its ridiculous.It really amazes me how you can publish a game like this.

Nevertheless, this game gathered my attention and being the cheapskate that I am, I planned to keep an eye on it and buy it at a sale. But I saw some content in which the game looked really fun and properly polished, so I decided to treat myself on the deluxe edition. Initially the game was fun despite a bunch of flaws (by which I mean both glitches and more subjective flaws based on my personal opinion); fun enough for me to still wholeheartedly recommend it. But at some point the negative started to outweigh the positive, so I guess I will only recommend this game when enough of the issues are addressed. Because of many of the glitches and clunkily implemented features, I doubt the game has been properly playtested. I heard the game was delayed on various occasions because of the difficulties with implementing the open world aspects, but it seems that at some point they gave up and released the unfinished product anyway. Since I bought the deluxe edition, I would assume I wouldn’t have to feel like playing a pre-release betatester and that a developer would have the decency to complete a game before releasing additional content to rake in more money. TT games isn’t the only one to execute ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practices like this (having some Cyberpunk 2077 vibes here), but it sure sucks it seems to become the standard. Here is a list of things I specifically like and things I don’t.Positive aspects• The game allows you to explore the galaxy a lot. In many areas you’re not constrained by objectives you have to progress because you’re in a mission, so you can help people on side missions, solve puzzles to get collectibles and just roam around and have some fun.• The dialogues are really fun. In the trailer I saw for the game, many of the jokes fell flat (for me), but in context they were much more fun. There are many jokes referencing the movies (and quotes referenced in memes), which I expect many to enjoy. A protocol droid next to the Tusken village, for example, will tell you it’s “home of not just the men, but the women and children too”. Characters selected can also have some interaction; Vader will tell Palpatine he already heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise countless times. • Visually it generally looks very nice, with much of attention to detail, especially when it comes to the figures. The capes look like actual fabric, and the figures themselves even have lines from the molds and a real plastic-looking shine.• Flying freely in space in combat is very smooth, at least it is with mouse and keyboard. For me it fits perfectly between the classic and new Battlefront II, meaning it’s both easy to steer to fly and to aim to shoot. On a controller, I found steering much harder, but that’s probably also the result of me being less used to controllers.Negative aspects• It’s not always clear where freeplay starts and ends. You can complete story related objectives in the open world parts, but it’s not clear when you can and can’t select other characters to complete puzzles that require a certain type of character.• The missions that don’t take place in the open world are very short. Especially when replaying them it felt glaringly obvious how less content there is in this regard. The Sarlacc/sail barge mission, for example, has a small portion that immediately starts on deck with Luke and Lando and then cuts to a boss fight against Jabba with Leia and R2-D2. It was fun to actually fight Jabba in person, but the whole mission was very short compared to the skiff hopping and below deck objectives of Lego Star Wars II.• There is a reason I spoke about “flying freely in space combat” before, and that is that in a bunch of missions, you can’t fly freely. It really makes it feel like you’re stuck on a monorail with limited space to move. In the Naboo submarine mission this felt somewhat logical, but for others (the Millenium Falcon asteroid chase and the Death Star I trench run) it felt really limiting and annoying. In missions such as the Jango Fett Geonosis chase and the Naboo Trade Federation control ship battle you’re allowed to move much more freely, making these missions much more enjoyable.• This monorail feeling also applies to many of the boss fights, portions of which you will be locked onto the boss without being able to unlock again (locking onto bosses in games can be useful, but it’s better if you can lock onto the boss yourself and disable it again as well). The game also heavily relies on quicktime events during these boss fights, which really removes a sense of urgency and personal skill when battling them. And unfortunately, these quicktime events regularly take some time to be triggered. When battling Dooku, at some point he just kept taking a beating with the same amount of barely any health, and after my 300 combo he required multiple seconds to walk to the right place to trigger the final quicktime event.• Many interesting potential missions are relegated to cutscenes, which is very unfortunate. You get to enter Palpatine’s office to arrest him as Windu and Fisto, but not to fight him, and space/vehicle battles such as the battle of Coruscant, battle of Geonosis and the Death Star II battle are just there as cutscenes. • There are various missions causing massive framerate drops without any ‘visual justification’ to back it up. The Geonosis factory and Ewok village don’t look better than most other places, so they shouldn’t cause such low framerates.• Once a mission is started, you can’t leave it without completing it (or so it seems).• The main menu animation can’t be skipped, so you’ll have to sit through Rey’s “I need someone to show me my place in all this” and the slow zoom out every time you want to load a savegame or leave the game altogether. And as a player, you’re not allowed to show her her place in all that, which definitely is not in the center above all other characters. Jarring. • The intro animation skip also doesn’t work properly; it says you need to hold F to skip it, but you first need to tap a key (either F or another one) first. • The character selection menu isn’t user friendly. There’s a lot of character classes with specific characters, and you can’t navigate the menus with your mouse.  • The game doesn’t always seem to properly apply the character you selected. Not the one you picked altogether sometimes (because it seems to think you selected it already, although you’re obviously not that character), but also not the specific version of that character you selected. In many instances, this game just doesn’t seem to want me to play as the stormtrooper commander with the spooling gun, so I’ll keep ending up with the regular one with the regular blaster.• Even when in freeplay, it’s sometimes impossible to switch characters from your preselected ones, so you’ll have to switch with the character next to you first.• The game also seems to have a hard time remembering which characters you had selected when entering/leaving a room. And switching to the one you’re not isn’t always possible because the game seems to think you’re already that character while you’re not.• The rotating mini-map (if you select the option) forgets to rotate a lot. You can make it rotate again by switching with the character next to you (and back), but it sucks I have to keep doing it every single time I enter another area.• Enemies are sparse in numbers when compared to the large amounts of the earlier Lego Star Wars games and are unlikely to kill you. Characters with activated lightsabers will automatically reflect blaster bolts without requiring the need to hold a block button. You’re much more likely to die because of one of the next few bulletpoints.[REST OF THE REVIEW IN THE COMMENTS]"}]}, {"game_id": "915810", "game_title": "Midnight_Ghost_Hunt", "overall_score": "- 82% of the 2,467 user reviews for this game are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Early Access", "Combat", "Multiplayer", "Team-Based", "FPS", "PvP", "First-Person", "Supernatural", "Action", "1990's", "Indie", "Shooter", "Realistic", "Sci-fi", "Comedy", "Tactical", "3D", "Third-Person Shooter", "Controller", "Artificial Intelligence"], "reviews": [{"username": "Risky", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "---{ Graphics }---☐ You forget what reality is☑ Beautiful☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it☐ MS-DOS---{ Gameplay }---☐ Very good☑ Good☐ It's just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don't---{ Audio }---☐ Eargasm☐ Very good☑ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deaf---{ Audience }---☐ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☑ Grandma---{ PC Requirements }---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☑ Decent☐ Fast☐ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{ Difficulty }---☐ Just press 'W'☐ Easy☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Significant brain usage☐ Difficult☐ Dark Souls---{ Grind }---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☑ Isn't necessary to progress☐ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You'll need a second life for grinding---{ Story }---☑ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☐ Lovely☐ It'll replace your life---{ Game Time }---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☑ Average☐ Long☐ To infinity and beyond---{ Price }---☐ It's free!☑ Worth the price☐ If it's on sale☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your money---{ Bugs }---☑ Never heard of☐ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs---{ ? / 10 }---☐ 1☐ 2☐ 3☐ 4☐ 5☐ 6☑ 7☐ 8☐ 9☐ 10"}, {"username": "Relic", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Most fun I have had in a while!

I've played it for a little while, having picked it up when it first released as early access on steam and its development has been amazing to watch. With entirely new campaigns and massive boosts to the games performance, modding capabilities, and base game throughout.  DestructionOriginally I was drawn to it after hoping for something to rekindle that feeling of Red Faction: Guerrilla and other destruction focused games, Teardown more than delivered on that front. Pretty much everything can be destroyed in many different ways, structures can even catch fire, fire which then spreads in a realistic fashion, burning buildings down to the ground or making them a burnt out husk. It really is a game where a building with a locked door can be resolved in many ways: Breaking through a nearby window, using your blowtorch to burn out the lock, or just driving a piece of heavy construction machinery through the wall.  Story / plot In terms of story and plot, your character operates a small family run business that had previously been struggling to keep the lights on. Until one day you get an email to perform a somewhat \"unauthorised demolition\" from here things just grow larger, seeing you knocking down towers, stealing priceless art, causing petty vandalism against a wealthy car owner. Eventually you find yourself stealing military weapons, visiting tropical islands, uncovering dastardly plots, and you also get to fight killer robots!  Modding  It's safe to say that from my perspective, the game has a wonderful and vibrant modding community, with plenty of active modding support provided by the devs, and a decent API to work with. Modders have made things ranging from advanced weapons to destroy structures, functional portal guns, AC 130 airstrikes, massive amounts of high quality vehicles from movies and real life, entire custom levels  and even campaigns that involve high quality detailing and interaction for players to enjoy.  There have even been mods made that completely change the nature of the game, such as turning it into a fire fighter sim, a hack and slash shooter game, even old school games. In effect the modding allows people to turn the engine to make whatever they can think of.  The Devs  The devs simply have been amazing. Really friendly and active with the community on the games discord. Quite often you'll find the devs getting really engaged with whatever creations modders are coming up with, and having very good discussions with the community, clearly laying out plans and often delivering more than we could have hoped for in the community. This is one of those games that have been boosted by having such active and driven devs who genuinely care about the game.  Conclusion / Should I buy / TL:DR Teardown is a fantastic game filled with plenty of content to keep you busy. It more than is worth its initial cost and the content keeps growing from there. Personally I've found it to be exactly the game I had wanted for a long time but just hadn't seen delivered anywhere near as well as it has been here. 10/10 would recommend again."}, {"username": "pwnedgod", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "You like blocky games?You like destroying stuff?You like making shortcuts by blowing up buildings?You like abusing saves to achieve the perfect game?This is the game for you."}, {"username": "BadDorok749", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Everything goes \"BOOM\", including your own PC."}, {"username": "Embrace Ralsei", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Teardown development team:⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠋⠉⠈⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢏⣴⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⣾⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⢢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⠀⡴⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠶⢴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣁⡀⠀⠀⢰⢠⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⣴⣶⣿⡄⣿⣿⡋⠀⠀⠀⠎⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠗⢘⣿⣟⠛⠿⣼⣿⣿⠋⢀⡌⢰⣿⡿⢿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣧⢀⣼⣿⣿⣷⢻⠄⠘⠛⠋⠛⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣧⠈⠉⠙⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠈⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢃⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠴⢗⣠⣤⣴⡶⠶⠖⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡸⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⢠⣾⣿⠏⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠉⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠈⢹⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠈⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⡟⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠁⠀⠀⠹⣿⠃⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠉⠉⠁⠀⢻⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠈⣿⣿⡿⠉⠛⠛⠛⠉⠉⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⢀⣀⣠⡴⣸⣿⣇⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡿⠄⠙⠛⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⠄"}, {"username": "Tarciryan", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Nobody bothered to mention that the entire story / 'campaign' is timed puzzles.

The destruction is so satisfying, and all you wish for is more and more. During the campaign you often spend a large amount of time trying to plan stuff out, destroying things in a particular way, setting up planks and vehicles creatively such that you can get all the objectives done in time. When you then complete the level, it is super satisfying. Furthermore the campaign itself is also pretty interesting, with different types of level objectives available, with a nice background story to it all as well. The progression feels great too, with more tools of destruction becoming available to you over time.My utmost respect to the creators of Teardown. Not only is it an amazing piece of software, it is also a fantastically designed game.

Make Arlan's patch match so it stays on the same eye between his avatar in the store and the big version next to the dialog.2. Make it easier to revive your friends.  Possibilities include sacrificing some of your own life to save them, high-five to split life equally between two players (like Toejam & Earl), certain store items that revive them, reviving on mini-boss fights etc. 3.

I've only played for around 100 minutes as of writing and I am already in love. However it does need some re-balancing. Now to be fair, I wrote this on the day it came out, so obviously there are gonna be some balance issues. I'm just gonna list about things I noticed:Conquest Mode: This is the main mode of the game, where you invade sectors across 4 islands and conquer the enemy base at the end. It has a cool risk and reward system where the more sectors you invade, the more units and abilities you get, however the stronger the enemy becomes. The only thing I have to say about this game mode is that it needs difficulty descriptions for the sectors, as some battles will be harder than others and you can't really tell.Endless Mode: Pretty obvious here, you pick whatever units you want and survive as long as possible against an enemy that's getting more and more difficult as it progresses, I didn't really find many issues with it, but I wasn't really too interested either.Random Battle: This is honestly my favorite mode. you spawn with varied (i would say random but I think some units are always added no matter what for fairness) units and try and defeat the enemy AI. Its nice for trying out new units and is also nice as you don't have full control over your starting units. I think the AI do need to be updated, as each difficulty seems rather easy to beat no matter which you select.Balance issues:your regular standard grunt unit has a grenade launcher that can nearly insta-kill basic enemy units (I should note now this game has no multiplayer and some of the AI's units are different than yours) - To fix this, maybe make it a tier 1 upgrade, as to be fair, they only get 1 shot, they can miss it, and it is useful for enemy defenses and vehicles.you can spawn 3 support units, and I believe their buffs might stack, which is pretty unfair, plus they have an artillery attack and having 3 of them at once using it seems a lil unfair.you can spawn 3 snipers who will sit FAR from the enemy and just pick them off without destroying the enemy base. they do insta-kills on infantry so you could essentially just grind with them, or spawn a single unit and just push with them while the snipers cover, and the snipers get a HUGE range boost when you use the hold button, making them even more unfair - my idea for this is to just make it so you can only spawn one, they can only push a little forward, and are more defensive type unitsthe shield units can be spawned in 3s and are really useful when the enemy has a lot of infantry or snipers, but i think their health should be reduced some.you can spam turrets with enough funds in clustered groups.units don't need to recharge which means as soon as one dies, you can instantly spawn another, which is fine for weaker units, but is really unfair for your tougher units, plus some units have abilities to spawn more units that don't add to your unit limit/supply/whatever its called.other than that and some other issues I probably don't know about, the game is fun and is a good way to waste time, plus it has no micro transactions, which also a plus in my bookIdeas I have:More unitsmore mapsdifferent themed enemies (aesthetics mostly, but having different themed enemies with their own custom units would be cool as well)more unit customization, maybe different base designs or unit outfits, or anything along those lines.Different types of battles. This might need some explanation. I noticed that based on difficulty, the enemy will have a different base designs each time. I think these bases having their own abilities would be cool, for example, there is an enemy base that is basically a big friggen missile on the back of a truck. maybe you need to destroy the truck before time runs out, or maybe a base that has turrets and can defend itself. Stuff like that.TL;DR the game is fun and a good time waster. It needs some balance patches for cheesy strats against the AI, but other than that I recommend this game absolutelyPS: all the songs in this game are absolute bangers"}, {"username": "GAR", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Fun for a couple of hours.

I want to call it a \"lazy strategy\" in the best way possible. You can take as much time as necessary to prepare for your missions and plan them out, and even on the field, there's ample time to understand your next move at every step. Units seem to have clear counters and strengths, upgrade progression feels nice, it feels well balanced all around.One of my favourite things about Warpips so far is, I never feel like I have to think about too much at once. I can enjoy the chaos, without straining my brain to the point that I can no longer focus on anything aesthetic at all {looking at you, Starcraft}. The fact that there is very little micro-management in this game means the player is truly in more of a \"commander\" seat, rather than an all-controlling god. You just say what your army should look like, and when they should move, but they'll figure out the details themselves. Your main job tends to be appreciating the hilarious pixel-art mayhem that ensues after dropping hundreds of dollars on expensive war equipment.I would really just love to see more content for the game. More units, upgrades, abilities, maps and map types, multiplayer co-op and PvP, other game modes, almost anything honestly.

Turned out I need to backtrack, but only figured it out because of desperate confusion...  I understand the idea of exploration being cool, but it really slows the kinetic sensation of combat, which would be better avoided.

The first couple of hours were fairly fun, learning how to play and unlocking new items - but it quickly became repetitive. There just aren't enough interesting features to keep the gameplay fresh for a long time.You literally just buy things and then resell them for a markup. You can buy shirts and then sell them, or buy wool, craft them into shirts and sell them for a slightly higher profit. Crafting does not feel very special - it's just a click, and there's no way to experiment or learn new recipes, they automatically unlock by themselves. As soon as you unlock a new recipe, merchants will also begin selling that item so it doesn't feel like much of an achievement. The more you craft a certain recipe, the higher chance your item will turn out better quality, but merchants also sell great quality items. So you can work really hard to make a couple of extra gold profit, but it doesn't FEEL particularly cool. It also seems strange that there's a farming system that lets you automate most of the alchemy craft, and part of cooking, but no systems that interact with the other crafting trees. I feel like alchemy must be much more profitable than other crafting trees because you can constantly get free herbs by growing them. Gameplay during the day is a little strange - customers serve themselves as long as you have the item they want on display. But each display can only hold one of each item so you have to be restocking constantly, which you do by just pressing R on the shelf. So most of the game you spend just standing next to shelves spamming R. You can hire employees to restock for you, but it feels like a waste of money because it's very easy to run around pressing R, and if you have employees restocking for you then you pretty much just stand there doing nothing anyway. At the start of the game you are told that you need to pay back your family's debt, and have to pay a certain amount every 4-5 days or its game over. Other than that, there's no story to the game. There are no NPC events and you can't talk to anybody. There are some \"events\" that explain why some things become more expensive or why NPCs want certain types of items, but you don't really feel any impact. E.g. the game might tell you that your country is at war, so tools and metal are more in demand, but there's no backstory about why that's happening, and nothing changes to make you FEEL it, e.g. military NPCs come to the shop.The coolest part of the game is probably the shop building element. Expanding your shop is pretty intuitive and there's quite a lot of different furniture items to decorate your shop however you like. The problem is that it is very expensive to expand even just a few squares. I played on Hard mode for my first game and never had a problem paying off my debts each week. However even when I had to pay back 900 gold at the end of the week towards my debt, it would cost me 1100+ to expand my shop by 4-5 tiles. The debt ends up feeling like an annoying money sink that just prevents you from playing with the only fun mechanic in the game. In summary, after a couple of hours I ended up in an endless cycle of buying materials, crafting them and putting them on display. Over and over, then after a week or two I could expand the shop by a couple of squares. I wish there was more content, like NPCs with personalities, rare crafting items that only the player can make and can't be bought from merchants. Maybe you can hire other employees who can mine for you or hunt?

The employees are great to keep everything stocked on the shelves but you get lost with all the crafting and gardening required to really get those top profits.

The first couple of hours were fairly fun, learning how to play and unlocking new items - but it quickly became repetitive. There just aren't enough interesting features to keep the gameplay fresh for a long time.You literally just buy things and then resell them for a markup. You can buy shirts and then sell them, or buy wool, craft them into shirts and sell them for a slightly higher profit. Crafting does not feel very special - it's just a click, and there's no way to experiment or learn new recipes, they automatically unlock by themselves. As soon as you unlock a new recipe, merchants will also begin selling that item so it doesn't feel like much of an achievement. The more you craft a certain recipe, the higher chance your item will turn out better quality, but merchants also sell great quality items. So you can work really hard to make a couple of extra gold profit, but it doesn't FEEL particularly cool. It also seems strange that there's a farming system that lets you automate most of the alchemy craft, and part of cooking, but no systems that interact with the other crafting trees. I feel like alchemy must be much more profitable than other crafting trees because you can constantly get free herbs by growing them. Gameplay during the day is a little strange - customers serve themselves as long as you have the item they want on display. But each display can only hold one of each item so you have to be restocking constantly, which you do by just pressing R on the shelf. So most of the game you spend just standing next to shelves spamming R. You can hire employees to restock for you, but it feels like a waste of money because it's very easy to run around pressing R, and if you have employees restocking for you then you pretty much just stand there doing nothing anyway. At the start of the game you are told that you need to pay back your family's debt, and have to pay a certain amount every 4-5 days or its game over. Other than that, there's no story to the game. There are no NPC events and you can't talk to anybody. There are some \"events\" that explain why some things become more expensive or why NPCs want certain types of items, but you don't really feel any impact. E.g. the game might tell you that your country is at war, so tools and metal are more in demand, but there's no backstory about why that's happening, and nothing changes to make you FEEL it, e.g. military NPCs come to the shop.The coolest part of the game is probably the shop building element. Expanding your shop is pretty intuitive and there's quite a lot of different furniture items to decorate your shop however you like. The problem is that it is very expensive to expand even just a few squares. I played on Hard mode for my first game and never had a problem paying off my debts each week. However even when I had to pay back 900 gold at the end of the week towards my debt, it would cost me 1100+ to expand my shop by 4-5 tiles. The debt ends up feeling like an annoying money sink that just prevents you from playing with the only fun mechanic in the game. In summary, after a couple of hours I ended up in an endless cycle of buying materials, crafting them and putting them on display. Over and over, then after a week or two I could expand the shop by a couple of squares. I wish there was more content, like NPCs with personalities, rare crafting items that only the player can make and can't be bought from merchants. Maybe you can hire other employees who can mine for you or hunt?

With that said, I have greatly enjoyed my time with this game.If I were to compare it to an existing title I have experience with, it reminds me of moonlighter but without the dungeon system and with more emphasis placed on the shop management side of the game. Where moonlighter focused (In my opinion too much) on the dungeoning, Winkeltje is through and through solely a shop builder.There are many different options for the type of shop to specialise into - from alchemy, to tool crafting, to cooking, and clothing. With an interesting system that tailors the customers you get to the types of items you sell - Sell lots of potions, and you'll get more requests for more advanced potions for example - but this system also only tracks the previous few days of sales, so if you want to switch focus then you can.The decoration and customisation in the shop itself is arguably one of its best strengths. Every furniture piece - as far as I can tell - sells for its buy price, so if you mess up a display and want to change it then you don't lose resources for doing so. I can't speak for the difficulty of dealing with the debt system and managing prices on the higher difficulties, but if you're looking for a shop management game which actually focuses entirely on managing the shop, with a minor focus on farming to get certain materials, then this is definitely the game for you."}, {"username": "s3lece", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Relaxing and incredibaly fun, 100% recommend to players that enjoy shop sims"}, {"username": "IggyBoo", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "It's a fun game and progression is paced pretty well.

It isn't a game where there is a goal or score. The purpose of Action Sandbox is purely amusement through the creation of simple or complex scenes, then exerting some control to see if the desired outcome was achieved. There are numerous objects to build a scene with, and these objects may be simple or very complex. Most have some properties that can be set through a context menu. Some type can be controlled while scene is in \"play\" mode. Although the objects have a three-dimensional feel to them, everything is from a side perspective, giving a flat look.Action Sandbox has some graphics options, although not very many. The only sound option is simply the volume for all sound. There is control customization, where the default keys can be changed, but for some reason, not all of the key that are used can be customized. This is annoying, particularly for left-handed players that remap controls to the keypad. There doesn't appear to be a good reason why some controls cannot be remapped, the developer seems to have just left them out. Action Sandbox also supports the loading of custom objects created by other players through the Steam Workshop, there are nearly 900 items available at present. The player can also build highly detailed custom objects from simple parts.The objects in Action Sandbox range from simple immobile crates and blocks to creatures and vehicles. The player can adjust the settings and properties for all of the objects to some degree. Simple objects have few properties, for example, a brick block can have its material changed from brick to glass, it can have its gravity and mass values changed, it can have colliders turned off, etc. Objects can be grouped together to create structures, simple or complex. There are NPC and \"Control\" objects that are more complex and controllable vehicles. In play mode, these can be movement controlled, doing things like making a car crash into a structure or NPCs. Some objects can fly, some have rotation controls in addition to flying. All of these objects and vehicles have physics properties which will determine what happens when they interact or collide with each other.The quality of the graphics, meaning the look and feel of the objects, NPCs, and vehicles is low. Everything has a very amateurish look to it, except for some of the menus. The game's engine is Unity and it appears that some scenes can cause the engine to slow down quite a bit. A fairly simple scene made of blocks that act like shattering glass with a few vehicles ground the frame rate down to single digits very quickly for no apparent reason. In another test, loads of vehicles breaking and shattering seemed to have no impact on performance at all. Action Sandbox is a simple looking physics sandbox, but has a tremendous amount of possible depth and complexity. A player could spend hours creating one scene and adjusting many of the details, but most players probably won't spend so much time in this game. Action Sandbox is marginally recommended for players that love physics sandboxes and don't mind putting in the time it would take to go beyond the basics."}, {"username": "reelee45紙袋", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "this game is amazing so fun"}, {"username": "Eluke10", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Good"}, {"username": "JaJaJaa", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "overly complicated people playground"}, {"username": "Bog", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "the tutorials are confusing and out of date not a lot of features mainly for people who spend there soul coding and stuff the played for a while but its not what i was expecting and i can just tell most of the ideas were from people playground"}, {"username": "InkyBoy", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "This is a bootleg version of peoples playground.

I've only played for around 100 minutes as of writing and I am already in love. However it does need some re-balancing. Now to be fair, I wrote this on the day it came out, so obviously there are gonna be some balance issues. I'm just gonna list about things I noticed:Conquest Mode: This is the main mode of the game, where you invade sectors across 4 islands and conquer the enemy base at the end. It has a cool risk and reward system where the more sectors you invade, the more units and abilities you get, however the stronger the enemy becomes. The only thing I have to say about this game mode is that it needs difficulty descriptions for the sectors, as some battles will be harder than others and you can't really tell.Endless Mode: Pretty obvious here, you pick whatever units you want and survive as long as possible against an enemy that's getting more and more difficult as it progresses, I didn't really find many issues with it, but I wasn't really too interested either.Random Battle: This is honestly my favorite mode. you spawn with varied (i would say random but I think some units are always added no matter what for fairness) units and try and defeat the enemy AI. Its nice for trying out new units and is also nice as you don't have full control over your starting units. I think the AI do need to be updated, as each difficulty seems rather easy to beat no matter which you select.Balance issues:your regular standard grunt unit has a grenade launcher that can nearly insta-kill basic enemy units (I should note now this game has no multiplayer and some of the AI's units are different than yours) - To fix this, maybe make it a tier 1 upgrade, as to be fair, they only get 1 shot, they can miss it, and it is useful for enemy defenses and vehicles.you can spawn 3 support units, and I believe their buffs might stack, which is pretty unfair, plus they have an artillery attack and having 3 of them at once using it seems a lil unfair.you can spawn 3 snipers who will sit FAR from the enemy and just pick them off without destroying the enemy base. they do insta-kills on infantry so you could essentially just grind with them, or spawn a single unit and just push with them while the snipers cover, and the snipers get a HUGE range boost when you use the hold button, making them even more unfair - my idea for this is to just make it so you can only spawn one, they can only push a little forward, and are more defensive type unitsthe shield units can be spawned in 3s and are really useful when the enemy has a lot of infantry or snipers, but i think their health should be reduced some.you can spam turrets with enough funds in clustered groups.units don't need to recharge which means as soon as one dies, you can instantly spawn another, which is fine for weaker units, but is really unfair for your tougher units, plus some units have abilities to spawn more units that don't add to your unit limit/supply/whatever its called.other than that and some other issues I probably don't know about, the game is fun and is a good way to waste time, plus it has no micro transactions, which also a plus in my bookIdeas I have:More unitsmore mapsdifferent themed enemies (aesthetics mostly, but having different themed enemies with their own custom units would be cool as well)more unit customization, maybe different base designs or unit outfits, or anything along those lines.Different types of battles. This might need some explanation. I noticed that based on difficulty, the enemy will have a different base designs each time. I think these bases having their own abilities would be cool, for example, there is an enemy base that is basically a big friggen missile on the back of a truck. maybe you need to destroy the truck before time runs out, or maybe a base that has turrets and can defend itself. Stuff like that.TL;DR the game is fun and a good time waster. It needs some balance patches for cheesy strats against the AI, but other than that I recommend this game absolutelyPS: all the songs in this game are absolute bangers"}, {"username": "GAR", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Fun for a couple of hours.

I can enjoy the chaos, without straining my brain to the point that I can no longer focus on anything aesthetic at all {looking at you, Starcraft}. The fact that there is very little micro-management in this game means the player is truly in more of a \"commander\" seat, rather than an all-controlling god.

I've played it for a little while, having picked it up when it first released as early access on steam and its development has been amazing to watch. With entirely new campaigns and massive boosts to the games performance, modding capabilities, and base game throughout.  DestructionOriginally I was drawn to it after hoping for something to rekindle that feeling of Red Faction: Guerrilla and other destruction focused games, Teardown more than delivered on that front. Pretty much everything can be destroyed in many different ways, structures can even catch fire, fire which then spreads in a realistic fashion, burning buildings down to the ground or making them a burnt out husk. It really is a game where a building with a locked door can be resolved in many ways: Breaking through a nearby window, using your blowtorch to burn out the lock, or just driving a piece of heavy construction machinery through the wall.  Story / plot In terms of story and plot, your character operates a small family run business that had previously been struggling to keep the lights on. Until one day you get an email to perform a somewhat \"unauthorised demolition\" from here things just grow larger, seeing you knocking down towers, stealing priceless art, causing petty vandalism against a wealthy car owner. Eventually you find yourself stealing military weapons, visiting tropical islands, uncovering dastardly plots, and you also get to fight killer robots!  Modding  It's safe to say that from my perspective, the game has a wonderful and vibrant modding community, with plenty of active modding support provided by the devs, and a decent API to work with. Modders have made things ranging from advanced weapons to destroy structures, functional portal guns, AC 130 airstrikes, massive amounts of high quality vehicles from movies and real life, entire custom levels  and even campaigns that involve high quality detailing and interaction for players to enjoy.  There have even been mods made that completely change the nature of the game, such as turning it into a fire fighter sim, a hack and slash shooter game, even old school games. In effect the modding allows people to turn the engine to make whatever they can think of.  The Devs  The devs simply have been amazing. Really friendly and active with the community on the games discord. Quite often you'll find the devs getting really engaged with whatever creations modders are coming up with, and having very good discussions with the community, clearly laying out plans and often delivering more than we could have hoped for in the community. This is one of those games that have been boosted by having such active and driven devs who genuinely care about the game.  Conclusion / Should I buy / TL:DR Teardown is a fantastic game filled with plenty of content to keep you busy. It more than is worth its initial cost and the content keeps growing from there. Personally I've found it to be exactly the game I had wanted for a long time but just hadn't seen delivered anywhere near as well as it has been here. 10/10 would recommend again."}, {"username": "pwnedgod", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "You like blocky games?You like destroying stuff?You like making shortcuts by blowing up buildings?You like abusing saves to achieve the perfect game?This is the game for you."}, {"username": "BadDorok749", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Everything goes \"BOOM\", including your own PC."}, {"username": "Embrace Ralsei", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Teardown development team:⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠋⠉⠈⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢏⣴⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⣾⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⢢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⠀⡴⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠶⢴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣁⡀⠀⠀⢰⢠⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⣴⣶⣿⡄⣿⣿⡋⠀⠀⠀⠎⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠗⢘⣿⣟⠛⠿⣼⣿⣿⠋⢀⡌⢰⣿⡿⢿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣧⢀⣼⣿⣿⣷⢻⠄⠘⠛⠋⠛⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣧⠈⠉⠙⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠈⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢃⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠴⢗⣠⣤⣴⡶⠶⠖⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡸⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⢠⣾⣿⠏⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠉⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠈⢹⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠈⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⡟⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠁⠀⠀⠹⣿⠃⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠉⠉⠁⠀⢻⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠈⣿⣿⡿⠉⠛⠛⠛⠉⠉⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⢀⣀⣠⡴⣸⣿⣇⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡿⠄⠙⠛⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⠄"}, {"username": "Tarciryan", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Nobody bothered to mention that the entire story / 'campaign' is timed puzzles.

The destruction is so satisfying, and all you wish for is more and more. During the campaign you often spend a large amount of time trying to plan stuff out, destroying things in a particular way, setting up planks and vehicles creatively such that you can get all the objectives done in time. When you then complete the level, it is super satisfying.

The core game is fine, it's just that there were a lot of really odd balancing decisions that don't make a lot of sense.The game revolves around assigning different attacks to \"barrages\", which can then be assigned to a button. Barrages can be chained into combos, which run on a stamina bar. There's a lot of experimentation involved, which is sometimes rewarded and sometimes not.An example of the former are the secret move combos that most weapons have, which usually come with a unique animation. One I found early on was that if you equip two swords and have your barrages set up to be alternating horizontal slashes (left to right, right to left) combined with four points of jump skills, you get a move that more or less turns your character into a flying blender.The latter are far more common. The best example of this I can think of is the Wave ability, which fires a projectile from your weapon when swung. While most skills don't care whether you're doing a \"light\" or \"heavy\" attack, Wave only works with specific heavy attack setups.. but the game will happily allow you to equip it in a spot where it does nothing but waste stamina. The only time the game will ever stop you is if you have a completely incompatible moveset - something like trying to use gun attacks on a sword.Now we get to the bad parts. There's no easy way to quickly switch up your barrages - which is a problem when you're trying to use a gun (which certain enemies are immune to for no apparent reason) or trying to switch up elemental skills to hit weaknesses or avoid immunities. You can unlock the ability to have pre-set barrages you can switch to with one button, but given that there's five elements (Fire, Ice, Storm, Lightning, Evil) there's no way to buy enough to be able to quick-switch all of your barrages over. You also have to find a specific building during your run to switch up your pre-set combos.There's also the very strange balance decision to make certain enemies (notably some of the eight bosses you have to defeat to finish the game) completely immune to ranged attacks, which renders the gun and bow kind of useless compared to melee weapons, which nothing is immune to. Despite all of this, Samurai Bringer isn't a bad game, though I would recommend looking up a guide to figure out how all of the skills work - since again, a lot of it isn't documented in the game anywhere."}, {"username": "Cherry Man", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "What the heck, this game is so cool?!This title seemed to come out of nowhere for me my impression after many hours is that I have rarely played a $10 title with this much polish and charm. The graphics are bright and vibrant, with a cute deformed design to its characters which highlights their iconic historic and legendary appearances, as well as a really great implementation of a pixel filter to really channel some old-school 16-bit vibes in tandem with the beep boop music and sound effects. You're essentially playing a top-down Dynasty Warriors roguelite where each run you aren't merely collecting stat bonuses and other powerups, but you are also collecting the very building blocks of gameplay. These allow you to construct your own moves and abilities in a wide variety of combinations, adding attack types, elemental damage, properties such as AOE shockwaves, multiple hits, telekinetic weapon control, off-screen support fire, and more to create your own arsenal of moves. The game does a great job of illustrating what is possible with the system through the starting loadouts you unlock (150+ of them) from defeating legendary Sengoku-era samurai and other figures.On top of this are a wide variety of charming little Zelda-esque puzzles, boss fights against massive oni and the dreaded Yamata-no-Orochi, and dozens and dozens on in-game challenges to work toward.Zero issues on PC with controller, looks and runs great."}, {"username": "DSM-5K", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "The mechanics are genius, the fast and linear run to being strong enough to beat the game easily then never struggle again isn't.

Still recommended anyway because it's great and only $10 but for how much I loved the first 8 hours it's just kinda disappointing that it never goes anywhere from there :(The custom moveset builder is fun, flexible and unique, and I would love to play with it. The Monster Hunter-style gearing system provides a surprising amount of depth and allows you to scale your power to absurd levels if you put in the time. The huge cast of characters is cool and telegraphs how to build advanced moves and combos very well.Unfortunately, the game is very easily beaten without engaging with any of that. No matter what weapon type or attack animation you choose, just stacking a bunch of \"attack an additional time\" scrolls on it makes it the best possible attack to use against any enemy in the game. Building long, intricate combos does more harm than good because your hits send enemies flying backward and your followup swings will miss - you can just give your single move a bunch of extra attacks and do far more damage. Sure you could create a pounce move (jump + step + power) and work it into your combos to leap to the target after knocking them back... or you can give your one single move a bunch of extra attacks and it will kill everything in the game in a single hit.There's also not much foresight in balance of your available options. If you create a Bow or Fan spell, some elements (Lightning) are just plain bad because they are only capable of hitting a target once. Fire or Ice on the other hand will give you several piercing projectiles that can have homing capabilities added to them so they spin in circles hitting the same target dozens of times. Even better, the Evil element will give you a screen-wide AoE that actually hits 2 entire screens away and hits every target hundreds of times, effectively one-shotting everything - AND if it doesn't one-shot them it drains all of their SP and makes them unable to act.Elements in general give you a lot of zany, cool options - but again, there's no reason to experiment with them because Fire makes you deal more damage, plus you can just add extra hits to any attack to make it one-shot everything even without an element.Enemy stats scale based on time spent in the current run, but I spent about 4 hours in a single run and they didn't scale to the point where I stopped one-shotting them.Anyway, it's still an incredibly good game for the first ~6-8 hours, and a pretty mindless grind with no rewards and no incentive to experiment afterward. It would be greatly served by the addition of some kind of super-high-enemy-stats mode like Chaos mode in Dynasty Warriors, so that these generals I'm running around genociding were actually threatening and would take skill and a competent build to defeat. If they stopped dying in one hit I would at least be incentivized to make multi-hit combos."}, {"username": "Felipepepe", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "A Dynasty Warriors-esque roguelike with a complex attack customization system.

I was expecting a fun little game, considering its price. I saw the trailer and was very interested.I played it, spent 2 hours playing non-stop without noticing.The game is great, the graphics are unique. The gameplay is a mix of God Hand (fully customizable combos), Dynasty Warriors (enemy numbers + stun locking the enemy general) with a \"create your own attack\" system which makes you the one who decides how strong or fast your attacks are. Weapons and armor have no rarity, they have 1 passive skill (or none in some cases), and they have variant move sets depending if you dual wield weapons or single them.Its fast paced, fun and entertaining. And theres a lot of General armor suits to unlock (142 at the time of writting), you get them by beating the general in a run.As for issues, Generals have set HP and stats, meaning that some are stronger than others and you can be very unlucky with chests and get 4 strong generals drop from it on the very first map. I think they should make them scale better or make them a bit rarer on the first days of each run. I'd also like to see said \"trap chest\" to be less common, because in my second run of the 7 I opened, 5 of them were 4 generals.Another issue is the audio balance, the sound effects are extremely loud, and they can build on top of each other, making them louder.Those are the only issues I've found so far.

I honestly think you could make a diablo style campaign with these mechanics and I wouldn't have any problem playing through it with these gameplay mechanics alone.

Feeling like battles are determined by skill and not attrition is what makes roguelikes addictive in my opinion, having bulletsponges in roguelikes is really REALLY boring in my opinion. This is after the tutorial mind you, I am not talking about the first tutorial boss I am talking about the named \"minibosses\" that are in some levels.- Stunlock is also not a fun mechanic, there might be a way to get out these and there probably is when I've unlocked more scrolls but I feel it's important to note. It feels like if I get hit by the first hit in a 3 hit combo I need to stay there for all three, might get fixed later, still not a fun mechanic regardless, I would love to be able to dash out of these if atleast my reactions are good.- Being able to retreat feels really lame, I think you should aim at designing encounters that feel fair, giving the player the ability to retreat just feels like a bandaid for some encounters being unfair. I am NOT telling you to make the game easy but if you make me be able to win each encounter without trying to kill a bulletsponge for 5 minutes with really low damage I don't need to be able to retreat.

StoryLego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga includes the Story of all 9 Movies in a compressed way. The cutscenes are cut down to the very basic information’s of the Story, which isn’t a bad thing directly, since the Lego games were never meant for long drawn out cutscenes. It can be hard to follow what’s going on thou in case you haven’t seen the Movies. Over the course of the Story, you visit all Iconic locations from the franchise like you would expect. You can choose to either begin the game at Episode 1, 4 or 7, depending on the order you want to experience them.       Gameplay The gameplay is mostly the same as in the old games, destroy everything and loot studs! The game isn’t too hard and you don’t lose to much in case you die, its designed to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience and they definitely succeed with that. But thankfully, they did improve the game systems. The 380 Characters you can unlock are sorted into different categories like Jedi, Hero, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, Droid etc. Each category has different skills you can invest into which can be upgraded in 3 Tiers each on top. You get skill points by collecting Special Bricks in each level, which are rewarded for different goals and challenges.The combat system also got a general overhaul and is now more versatile compared to the old games.   Beside that you can also collect Mini-kits, Vehicles and of course, new Characters. The levels feel bigger to me like in the old games and more open ended. Each is filled with a ton of Stuff to do, if you enjoy collecting Items and upgrades, you will find your happiness here. And like in the old games, the levels are designed in a way, that not everything can be looted the first time you visit a location. Some items need talents or Characters you will only obtain later to reach.  Graphic and Audio The Graphic is a lovely mix of detailed Lego Models and Bricks/Structures and a more real general atheistic of the environments, which works out flawlessly in my eyes. The Audio is really good, it sounds like you would Star Wars expect to sound.    Final Thoughts If you enjoyed the old Lego games, you will immediately feel at home in the Skywalker Saga, all the new features, and a game that can be enjoyed solo or in coop with a friend, with the good Lego Humor on top guarantees a good time.

Nevertheless, this game gathered my attention and being the cheapskate that I am, I planned to keep an eye on it and buy it at a sale. But I saw some content in which the game looked really fun and properly polished, so I decided to treat myself on the deluxe edition. Initially the game was fun despite a bunch of flaws (by which I mean both glitches and more subjective flaws based on my personal opinion); fun enough for me to still wholeheartedly recommend it. But at some point the negative started to outweigh the positive, so I guess I will only recommend this game when enough of the issues are addressed. Because of many of the glitches and clunkily implemented features, I doubt the game has been properly playtested. I heard the game was delayed on various occasions because of the difficulties with implementing the open world aspects, but it seems that at some point they gave up and released the unfinished product anyway. Since I bought the deluxe edition, I would assume I wouldn’t have to feel like playing a pre-release betatester and that a developer would have the decency to complete a game before releasing additional content to rake in more money. TT games isn’t the only one to execute ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practices like this (having some Cyberpunk 2077 vibes here), but it sure sucks it seems to become the standard. Here is a list of things I specifically like and things I don’t.Positive aspects• The game allows you to explore the galaxy a lot. In many areas you’re not constrained by objectives you have to progress because you’re in a mission, so you can help people on side missions, solve puzzles to get collectibles and just roam around and have some fun.• The dialogues are really fun. In the trailer I saw for the game, many of the jokes fell flat (for me), but in context they were much more fun. There are many jokes referencing the movies (and quotes referenced in memes), which I expect many to enjoy. A protocol droid next to the Tusken village, for example, will tell you it’s “home of not just the men, but the women and children too”. Characters selected can also have some interaction; Vader will tell Palpatine he already heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise countless times. • Visually it generally looks very nice, with much of attention to detail, especially when it comes to the figures. The capes look like actual fabric, and the figures themselves even have lines from the molds and a real plastic-looking shine.• Flying freely in space in combat is very smooth, at least it is with mouse and keyboard. For me it fits perfectly between the classic and new Battlefront II, meaning it’s both easy to steer to fly and to aim to shoot. On a controller, I found steering much harder, but that’s probably also the result of me being less used to controllers.Negative aspects• It’s not always clear where freeplay starts and ends. You can complete story related objectives in the open world parts, but it’s not clear when you can and can’t select other characters to complete puzzles that require a certain type of character.• The missions that don’t take place in the open world are very short. Especially when replaying them it felt glaringly obvious how less content there is in this regard. The Sarlacc/sail barge mission, for example, has a small portion that immediately starts on deck with Luke and Lando and then cuts to a boss fight against Jabba with Leia and R2-D2. It was fun to actually fight Jabba in person, but the whole mission was very short compared to the skiff hopping and below deck objectives of Lego Star Wars II.• There is a reason I spoke about “flying freely in space combat” before, and that is that in a bunch of missions, you can’t fly freely. It really makes it feel like you’re stuck on a monorail with limited space to move. In the Naboo submarine mission this felt somewhat logical, but for others (the Millenium Falcon asteroid chase and the Death Star I trench run) it felt really limiting and annoying. In missions such as the Jango Fett Geonosis chase and the Naboo Trade Federation control ship battle you’re allowed to move much more freely, making these missions much more enjoyable.• This monorail feeling also applies to many of the boss fights, portions of which you will be locked onto the boss without being able to unlock again (locking onto bosses in games can be useful, but it’s better if you can lock onto the boss yourself and disable it again as well). The game also heavily relies on quicktime events during these boss fights, which really removes a sense of urgency and personal skill when battling them. And unfortunately, these quicktime events regularly take some time to be triggered. When battling Dooku, at some point he just kept taking a beating with the same amount of barely any health, and after my 300 combo he required multiple seconds to walk to the right place to trigger the final quicktime event.• Many interesting potential missions are relegated to cutscenes, which is very unfortunate. You get to enter Palpatine’s office to arrest him as Windu and Fisto, but not to fight him, and space/vehicle battles such as the battle of Coruscant, battle of Geonosis and the Death Star II battle are just there as cutscenes. • There are various missions causing massive framerate drops without any ‘visual justification’ to back it up. The Geonosis factory and Ewok village don’t look better than most other places, so they shouldn’t cause such low framerates.• Once a mission is started, you can’t leave it without completing it (or so it seems).• The main menu animation can’t be skipped, so you’ll have to sit through Rey’s “I need someone to show me my place in all this” and the slow zoom out every time you want to load a savegame or leave the game altogether. And as a player, you’re not allowed to show her her place in all that, which definitely is not in the center above all other characters. Jarring. • The intro animation skip also doesn’t work properly; it says you need to hold F to skip it, but you first need to tap a key (either F or another one) first. • The character selection menu isn’t user friendly. There’s a lot of character classes with specific characters, and you can’t navigate the menus with your mouse.  • The game doesn’t always seem to properly apply the character you selected. Not the one you picked altogether sometimes (because it seems to think you selected it already, although you’re obviously not that character), but also not the specific version of that character you selected. In many instances, this game just doesn’t seem to want me to play as the stormtrooper commander with the spooling gun, so I’ll keep ending up with the regular one with the regular blaster.• Even when in freeplay, it’s sometimes impossible to switch characters from your preselected ones, so you’ll have to switch with the character next to you first.• The game also seems to have a hard time remembering which characters you had selected when entering/leaving a room. And switching to the one you’re not isn’t always possible because the game seems to think you’re already that character while you’re not.• The rotating mini-map (if you select the option) forgets to rotate a lot. You can make it rotate again by switching with the character next to you (and back), but it sucks I have to keep doing it every single time I enter another area.• Enemies are sparse in numbers when compared to the large amounts of the earlier Lego Star Wars games and are unlikely to kill you. Characters with activated lightsabers will automatically reflect blaster bolts without requiring the need to hold a block button. You’re much more likely to die because of one of the next few bulletpoints.[REST OF THE REVIEW IN THE COMMENTS]"}]}, {"game_id": "920210", "game_title": "LEGO_Star_Wars_The_Skywalker_Saga", "overall_score": "- 93% of the 17,042 user reviews for this game are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["LEGO", "Adventure", "Open World", "Multiplayer", "Space", "Co-op", "Action", "Sci-fi", "Singleplayer", "Funny", "Local Co-Op", "Third Person", "Family Friendly", "Story Rich", "Epic", "Great Soundtrack", "Memes", "Psychological Horror", "Beautiful", "Puzzle"], "reviews": [{"username": "MisterDahkness", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "It has a fully accessible jedi temple with younglings all over the place and dark side Anakin as a playable character.

StoryLego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga includes the Story of all 9 Movies in a compressed way. The cutscenes are cut down to the very basic information’s of the Story, which isn’t a bad thing directly, since the Lego games were never meant for long drawn out cutscenes. It can be hard to follow what’s going on thou in case you haven’t seen the Movies. Over the course of the Story, you visit all Iconic locations from the franchise like you would expect. You can choose to either begin the game at Episode 1, 4 or 7, depending on the order you want to experience them.       Gameplay The gameplay is mostly the same as in the old games, destroy everything and loot studs! The game isn’t too hard and you don’t lose to much in case you die, its designed to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience and they definitely succeed with that. But thankfully, they did improve the game systems. The 380 Characters you can unlock are sorted into different categories like Jedi, Hero, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, Droid etc. Each category has different skills you can invest into which can be upgraded in 3 Tiers each on top. You get skill points by collecting Special Bricks in each level, which are rewarded for different goals and challenges.The combat system also got a general overhaul and is now more versatile compared to the old games.   Beside that you can also collect Mini-kits, Vehicles and of course, new Characters. The levels feel bigger to me like in the old games and more open ended. Each is filled with a ton of Stuff to do, if you enjoy collecting Items and upgrades, you will find your happiness here. And like in the old games, the levels are designed in a way, that not everything can be looted the first time you visit a location. Some items need talents or Characters you will only obtain later to reach.  Graphic and Audio The Graphic is a lovely mix of detailed Lego Models and Bricks/Structures and a more real general atheistic of the environments, which works out flawlessly in my eyes. The Audio is really good, it sounds like you would Star Wars expect to sound.    Final Thoughts If you enjoyed the old Lego games, you will immediately feel at home in the Skywalker Saga, all the new features, and a game that can be enjoyed solo or in coop with a friend, with the good Lego Humor on top guarantees a good time.

This game is amazing and inspired me to write this review which I usually don't do.So, let's get into it.This is my first Monster Taming game that isn't Pokémon so I didn't expect too much.But I thought it looked fun and decided to give it a shot.I'm glad I did since this game is absolutely worth it.This game looks and feels a lot like the older Pokémon games but it has so much more polish to it.I didn't expect the game to be very long but it actually surprised me how much there is to it.The storyline is actually quite well written and its quite enticing.Even the soundtrack is amazing!Every single Coromon has a great design and they feel original, although some of the names could be a bit better (Most are still great though).I absolutely advice you to get this game if you like Pokémon, this feels like a breath of fresh air.What I really loved about the game was it's difficulty.I played the game on \"Normal\" difficulty and the \"Bossfights\" were quite challenging.The game even has built-in and customizable difficulty settings.These options give the game more replayability if you'd like to do so.If you're hesitating about getting this game, add it to your wishlist, I absolutely recommend you to try this game!"}, {"username": "BedfastStun", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Good game overall, I really enjoyed it. 7.9/10. Personally, I would love to see some form of AI battle league where players can challenge an infinite amount of trainers with randomised Coromon in order to win prizes, maybe with a tournament mode and a regular single battle mode. I very much enjoy this game but am not keen on the online battling aspect of it and should something like this be introduced I would thoroughly enjoy sinking many more hours into it and feel that it would provide a great deal of content, especially with higher levelled trainers provided a player has finished the story.- The game has a somewhat distinct type advantage system which helps to keep it interesting while playing and diversify it from other creature collecting RPGs. - The designs and sprites for the Coromon are very well done, with a good mixture of 'cool' and 'cute' Coromon to help tailor a full team to a player's taste.- Interesting and mostly unique moves which help keep random encounters and trainer battles interesting.- Fantastic animations for Coromon and their moves as well as lovely environments and a very good soundtrack.- Coromon gain points, as well as levels, when battling which allow for one of their stats to be improved slightly which, for example, allows for a bulky, low damage, high defence Coromon to gain increased attack or special attack to make it a more rounded battler.- The game has a dedicated and caring development team who constantly take feedback from players in order to improve the game and player's experiences.However.- The story of the game (whilst likely isn't what most people would play for anyways) is pretty 'meh' with characters that weren't really all that memorable or likeable. Admittedly, I very much enjoyed it and it did have very fun moments such as the boss fights versus the Titans but the story isn't anything earth-shattering.- Whilst the Coromon are all very well designed, there isn't a hell of a lot of them (114 in total), instead there are 'Potent' and 'Perfect' variants, recolours of the original Coromon which have improved stats (admittedly I do think this is an interesting concept but It makes catching all Coromon and their Potent and Perfect variants a chore as it can feel quite repetitive). The diversity and quality of the designs does make up for this but it leads to many of the same Coromon showing up in trainer battles and random encounters too often.- There are few side-quests to do, so aside from collecting 'Potent' and 'Perfect' variants of Coromon and the main story, there isn't a lot of official content.- There is a lack of post-game content, in fact as far as I am aware, there is none at all, so aside from online battling and catching all Coromon there is little to do once you have completed the game. There also aren't many trainers that can be battled more than once, so if you are like me and aren't very fond of online battling then there isn't any point in training perfect Coromon for battling. Overall I would certainly recommend it, it's a good game with a fairly decent playtime (going by the '£1 an hour' rule I got double my money's worth) that remains engaging throughout. The game isn't terribly expensive and it's constantly being improved so It's worth a go."}, {"username": "DandyBagel", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I feel like I'm 12 years old again.

This game is great. I've you're itching for some old-school pokemon, this is your game. The way the game handles moves, stats, and bosses are really cool. The dungeons are also very cool and the game is actually challenging, which is a huge leap forward compared to pokemon. The monster design is decent, but only decent. However, there are a few big negatives that anyone should be aware of before choosing to buy.The first is that the movepool is pretty shallow and not very well distributed. I've been playing blind, and I've boxed multiple monsters because they just don't learn any good moves. This includes both the monster just not getting anything useful, as well as type mismatches like a strong special attacker learning no special moves for 20 levels or pokemon learning no moves of their type for 30+ levels. I've not found a single useable healing move either.The second is that some parts of the game include mandatory puzzles and or mini-games. While I like that idea in theory, in practice many of them are frustrating because they go on for too long or have extra random elements thrown in designed just to fluster the player. For example, before a particularly important fight, you have to play a game of Mastermind. I didn't mind that at all, and thought it was a fun little diversion. However after a few guesses, the game starts messing with you by doing things like making the screen go black, not letting you think about the pattern for any real amount of time, or scrambling all of your guesses so if you didn't have everything exactly memorized your back to square one. Ultimately neither of these big complaints have made me want to stop playing the game, however when they pop up they definitely detract from my enjoyment of an otherwise very fun pokemon clone."}, {"username": "Dawn", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Any monster taming games enjoyer will love this game.

Re-bought it on STEAM as I am swearing off consoles since everything is gonna come to PC eventually anyways. Plus to play the director's cut edition.Kojima's games have crazy technical mechanics with very simplified precision, there are a lot of cues in technicalities you can identify with previous MGS games, which is a good thing. Cause why change something that's already good right?Core gameplay loop is solid, interesting quest variations always come just before things get repetative or stale (Unless if you wanna max 5 star on every port), the quirky \"LIKE\" system that reverbrates throughout the game is surprisingly charming which not only is it a system, but the characters in the universe embraces the presentation of it. I sometimes find myself just giggling in childish joy while I shake my head seeing those quirks.The director's cut introduces features and items that makes the game much much easier than before. I remembered having a pretty rough time before. But it might also be that I know what I am already playing as I have experienced it once already.I kinda wished that some parts of the game could have been polished up even more:> Climbing up or down a rope: Sam's grip is ironclad no matter the weight. It somehow takes me out of the immersion when I already need a power skeleton to even help support what I am carrying as I traverse, but while on the rope I can carry however heavy I want and I will never slip or slide. I mean at least give Sam a 'glove claw' or a harness lock? Cause by the current logic, Sam's fingers are the strongest in the game, beating any power skeleton you can find.> Rappelling immersion could've been tighter: I'm guessing there are challenges to do this, but sometimes Sam dangles pretty awkwardly as he lifts or lowers himself off a steep edge. I would appreciate some sleek rappelling action like kicking off the wall and slipping down the rope real fast. Then maybe how hard you kick off and slide down depends on how long you hold a button for example. So it's still player controlled while bearing a little risk; like you shouldn't kick off and slide down too fast when you're nearing the ground but still at a hazardous elevated height. Cause you might just hit the ground kicking off too hard.Knowing how of a perfectionist Kojima is, he might have had his reasons for not addressing these things. Just surprised these questions haven't been asked, or I just haven't come across any articles or interviews about these things.Overall, this game is wet dream for any kid aspiring to be a FEDEX, AMAZON or DHL delivery man in a world full of rough terrain and steep drops. There's a weird sense of tranquility and meditation in every difficult delivery quest. When you mentally get tired, it would feel like a grind of just sprinting from one end to another, but when you turn off the game and wake up the next day, you will find yourself wanting to get into that tranquil journey once again.The lore is definitely interesting, though the narrative sometimes FEEL a little tryhard. Character names are.. very KOJIMA. I mean.. I know they are kinda like codenames. But you know.. I stop myself from cringing to give some respect. The man has taste in many things, but he is still interpreting the story from his Japanese point of view is what I can deduce.I LIKE this game."}]}, {"game_id": "1865780", "game_title": "Downfall__A_Slay_the_Spire_Fan_Expansion", "overall_score": "- 97% of the 1,082 user reviews in the last 30 days are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Indie", "Strategy", "RPG", "Mod", "Roguelike", "Card Game", "Roguelike Deckbuilder", "Free to Play"], "reviews": [{"username": "blalo'u", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I've been a part of the Downfall team for over a year and I'm proud of the amount of work my fellow modders (and let's be completely transparent it was mostly them, I'm just a bit of QA and balancing) have put into this expansion pass.

Above all, the game feels like a love letter to StS, retaining the appeal of the existing game while introducing new concepts that are built around the game's system and mechanics. With EIGHT new characters to try, each with a full card set and another Ascension ladder to climb, Downfall is not going to bore you anytime soon. - Hermit is a cursed gunslinger who revolves (pun intended) around Dead On cards, which gain extra effects when in the center of your hand. He can also take advantage of curses and even debuffs for extra versatility. - Slime Boss, more of a setup-based character, can Split into various types of slimes which have effects at start of turn. Overflowing on slimes gives you 1 Strength, making a slime spam strategy very tantalizing. Slime Boss can also stack on large amounts of Goop to deal ridiculous damage with one attack. - Guardian is more defensive, and essentially is Body Slam Ironclad on steroids. With easily available Block and Barricade and incredible cheese potential, you're going to have a lot of fun taking zero damage. - Hexaghost has a set of Ghostflames which trigger their effects after a certain condition is met, such as playing two Attacks. Adding to this is a new Afterlife keyword which lets you play a card as it's Exhausted, plus a new Poison-like status called Soulburn which deals insane damage after 3 turns. - Champ is basically Watcher for people who don't like taking 30+ damage after miscalculating their turn. While his Stances do nothing on their own, some of his cards have a Technique keyword, with varying effects depending on which Stance you're in. - My personal favorite, Automaton can Encode various cards into its Sequence, temporarily removing them from its deck cycle. Once 3 cards are in the Sequence, they're combined into one Function with the effects of all 3 cards. You don't need me to tell you how ridiculous this can get. - Gremlins consists of 5 different characters, who you can switch between with various cards. They each have a passive effect which can shape your deck, but make sure the Gremlin you're focusing on doesn't die. - Since no StS mod would be complete without a meme character, Snecko revolves around luck. Lots and lots of luck. Central to its mechanics are Unknown cards, which turn into random cards that satisfy a certain condition at the start of combat - including cards of a different class. Good luck.Adding to this incredible amount of content is the new Downfall mode, which essentially rewrites how an StS run is expected to go, mostly in ways that are best experienced blind. One of the more interesting changes in my opinion is the map - in Downfall, you start at the top of the map and travel down, with the boss at the bottom. However, the map's procedural generation isn't modified to take this into account, meaning that you will start each Act with a campfire, and there will likely be multiple enemy fights right before the boss. This makes boss fights, especially early bosses, much more stressful, as you might not be entering with full health.Overall, I highly recommend Downfall to anyone who is even mildly interested in more Slay the Spire content."}, {"username": "MoonaMoon", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I mean it's just free content what's there not to love?"}, {"username": "Kyotosomo", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "A free mod that adds even more depth to the game as well as triples the size of it, not to mention feels exactly as if it were made by the original developers.

However, the idea that this was assembled by a playtested team as opposed to one person who probably couldn't get enough feedback meant is what gave me the open mind to give it a fair-shake. The end result was me being amazed at how tight and clean the balance feels on all 8 classes. I was going to make a standout-list of my top 3, but I actually struggle to decide which are my top 3, which is impressive, considering that in base-game, I could rank the 4 vanilla characters in order from most preferable to least. The fact that I enjoy cycling between each means that my climb to A20 on all of these is going to be a hell of a ride.I can't believe this expansion is free.This is so good that it should just be called Slay The Spire 2, and if Mega Crit have not hired these content creators for future work officially, then all I can say is that I'll be mind-blown if future base-content can match this.Thanks, Table 9 Studio, you mad lads."}, {"username": "Vinayssus", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I've poured over 500 hours in Slay the Spire - BEFORE finding out about mods and looking into them.

You've got stances, unique cards crafted from 'programming' them mid-combat, or temporal stasis effects that let you play expensive cards without cost or charge up cards to alarming levels. Then again, you can also just curl up into a ball and stick your tongue out while the enemy dies trying to hurt you. That's pretty fun, too.All in all the art fits Slay the Spire (though much of it is reused/recoloured), the mechanics are innovative yet build on mechanics you've already encountered, and the new Downfall mode adds a lot of fun events, characters, and trickier boss fights than the default game has.It is, in other words, an ideal expansion.Now if I've timed this right you should have finished reading this review in the time it's taken to download the game.... but probably not."}, {"username": "deadeyedun", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Played a lot of the Downfall mod before this standalone release, and it's one of my favorite mods ever -- it's basically Slay the Spire 2.

It's really addicting going through all the new villains and unlocking all their new cards and relics.

First of all I need to say, that I was very hyped for this game and couldn't wait for it to be released and to play it. The game has a lot of potential and very interesting concepts.  When should you buy this game?   If you like Japan and are interested in japanese culture  If you like very good visuals in a game making your graphics card go brbrr  If you like exploring and taking your time in checking each corner of the map  If you like petting dogs and feeding them   If you like not very skill demanding games  If you are the story game type of player  If you like simple and straight forward skill trees and mechanics  If you like having a lot of side quests (some of them a bit repetitive)  Cons    The game feels to easy  Repetitive tasks  Not much to do if you leave away the collection of spirits (which takes most of your time)   Collecting spirits to level up becomes annoying after some time.  Combat is too easy and feels too basic. No enhanced mechanics.  COMBAT What disappoints me, is, that the combat system has a lot of potential which is unused and the fights are far tooo easy. I would say the game makes it a challenge to die. Basically, the combat system works like this: Press: hit, hit, hit, defend, hit, extract soul , hit, hit, hit, defend, hit, extract soul and so on. You have basically 3 to 4 elements you can change (wind, water, fire, ...) and I have the feeling that between water and wind there is nearly no difference (except maybe that striking with you water ability has a shorter range but is able to hit more targets at once) and the fire element makes most damage but you do not have a lot of munition for that one. You also get a bow, which is basically never needed (Only when you are seperated from KK because the story forces you to be and therefore you have no supernatural skills until you get him back ). You could litterally stand there without moving a cm when fighting against some enemies untill you killed them). You have no possibility to dash or something like that. Spamming the \"attack\" button does totally the trick here.I had already a boss fight and I need to say, that it was far too easy to win.  GAMEPLAY The city is beautiful and I can tell you: if you have the hardware you can enjoy a lot of small details, like the puddles on the floor where parts of buildings and lights are reflected in a beautiful manner. The details of the city are impressive: Buildings, objects etc. I mean the furr of the animals could have a bit more details, but I think the game is already demanding a lot of performance.Exploring is very nice because you can find a lot of loot in different corners. You can also use so called Tengus to \"catapult\" yourself on roof tops in order to float then from roof to roof for collecting spirits and finding stuff.If you are not simply rushing through the story, than you will spend the most time in collecting spirits. Collecting spirits allows you to level up in order to become better skills and additional abilities. Most of them are sort of: Increase attack speed, damage, increase floating time in the air, increase movement speed when crouching, increase number of arrows you can carry with you, etc. I'm Currently level 16 ( in the beginning of chapter 3) and I spent most of the time in doing side quests and collecting spirits (currently I have nearly 33.000 spirits (out of something like 250.000). In order to make it easier for you to spot them you have an ability which works like a radar so you can see their silhouette in the vicinity (until 30 m away, can be upgraded to 50).The entire city is shrouded in a fog that damages you as soon as you touch it. Therefore, so-called tori gates have to be cleaned so that the fog in the area disappears. In order to roam freely around, you need to find those gates and clean them. There are a lot of Yokais which ask you to find and collect different items for them which can be found in the city, appartements etc. Collecting a certain number of those will grant you items, emotes or even outfits.I mean, it is nice that you can change your outfit, but you will only see it in cutscenes, as you are playing in a first person view.  TECHNICAL ASPECTS I play the game on a 120 Hz 4k OLED screen using a RTX 3080 and an Intel I7 11700K and without DLSS and RayTracing enabled, the game would not be really playable from frame perspective. Using DLSS Balanced mode i get 45-80 fps which is a high fluctuation from my point of view. Of course it depends on the scene, the number of reflections displayed etc. Without DLSS I get something like 25 fps (Ray Tracing ON). Until now I couldn't experience any bugs (beside one crash of the entire game).  Conclusion I like the game very much although the combat is far too easy and there are a lot of repetitive tasks, because I like the aesthetic of the entire city, the light effects, simply the whole visuals of the game. I simply enjoy the story, farming a lot, enjoying the beauty of Tokyo.From my point of view, this is not a game where I think paying the full price is worth it and representing the buyers interests I would recommend waiting for a sale or something like this, because the game has nothing really outstanding (for those people who are not fully into japan, it's culture etc.), although it's a really good game.Yes, the city is beautiful, yes the details are lovely and dude: You can pet dogs and cats, but: All those things are not that mindblowing that I would say: Shut up and take my money (after knowing it better playing it nearly 15 hours)."}, {"username": "ClappingFetus", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Its not a terrible game, there are some interesting concepts and the graphics are awesome but the game as a whole just feels very underwhelming. This biggest shame is that the entire game is a check list of fetch quests and collectibles stuck inside amazing looking city that appears to have been created for a far different, far more interesting game that was likely scraped really late into development. As a result the whole thing feels like a patchwork job of padded out content made to salvage all the work that went into whatever this game was originally meant to be."}, {"username": "ixxel", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Mixed feelings.Positive:  The world is very detailed, and is reminiscent of Shibuya.  My first thought was... wow, that's the side street I went down to that hot pot place I hated that my friend took me to.Really, the best part of this game is the map.  It's very well detailed, and if you haven't been to Japan before, just know this is pretty much how it looks, with alternate logos and stuff.Downside:  Where to begin...  I'm bored.  like, 20+ hours after playing and writing this, I'm totally bored.  Like...  you do the same stuff over and over again.  Like I know, games can be repetitive, but wow...  um, this is the extreme.  Like literally you do the following the whole time:  use the same skill over and over again (there is one skill, with three elemental variations), oh, sometimes u can shoot arrows or use a talisman, but those cost money, so not your core skills; then you collect souls.  over and over again, you collect souls; and finally you pet a lot of dogs, and go collect random Japanese artifacts all in order to gain money, to spend on buying like 3 items that you need to collect in order to increase skill points, or stuff you need to unlock a higher tier of skills, which is still the only skill you have in the game, or some abilities, like ripping souls out of bodies with your fist.I'm mostly angry with myself for buying this game.  I didn't research it, and bought into the last minute hype I was seeing about the game and how amazing it was going to be, and then being a doofus and thinking the marketing videos were going to be anything like what they looked like in actual game play.Final thoughts:  I'll give it this.  Compared to some other games I've recently bought, like BF2042, this game is very well polished.  It's mostly free from bugs, and like, it's enjoyable, if not so absurdly repetitive I kind of question the developers and any discussions they may have had around enjoyment and play-ability of the game.  Again, the map is wonderful.  It's the the whole rest of the game that needs work.  Why one skill?!?!?!?!?!  Why the same basic crap over and over and over again...  it's so boring, and other than walking around and being reminded of fun times in Japan, this game is boring.  Very, very boring.  :\\"}, {"username": "TheBowWowers", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Just putting my 2 cents in since i see this game get bashed on for some reason.The game is like a combination of Open world RPG, japanese lore and a bit of horror. Obviously if compared with a game whose exclusive focus on only one of them (Elden ring, World of Horror and whatever horror games) it would not live up to the genre. This is expected, you're buying a fusion meal, expect a fusion meal.Another thing is the \"Repetitiveness of combat\". This makes no sense to me, practically every game with combat will have some sort of \"Repetitiveness\" in it. That's like saying \"Shadow of Mordor has pretty repetitive combat because i just run around hitting Orcs with my sword\". The only arguable point here is possibly _lack of variation_ in the combat. However for this, it kind of leads me into my next point......I dont think this game's selling point was ever the \"Ghost busting\" RPG aspects of gameplay. At least it wasnt for me. To me it would be definitely the eeriness/atmosphere of the game. The lore and story building.Meeting a hoarder's ghost and then going to his house and thinking \"Woah, this place is filthy!\".Or going through those weird dimension shifting/changing areas while trying to cleanse a location.Or trying to help some little ghost girl recover her possesed umbrella that makes you think umbrellas shouldnt be able to move that fast.Or helping some guy get rid of a traditional japanese doll whom he claims were \"Bringing him bad luck and caused his death\"Or talking to a shopkeeper nekomata, who to be frank i thought i would get to see some 4k fuzzy testicles on (This applies to the Tanukis too.... Why is it always no balls.....)These are the selling points for me and what keeps me going. On top of that, i find the amount of details put into the world really reminiscent of actual japan, going so far to even label individual soda, snacks and other confectioneries. Hell even the random posters i see on the wall have quite a number of variations to it. At times i would literally just walk around the world just to see what it looks like and to take in the sights so to speak.The main story so far is, at best, intriguing for me but not really something im fully invested in yet. It could be too early to tell. Im not sure. But definitely the side quests, though similiar in objectives, have some very interesting skits for me. Also just to add on, im okay with the MC and his spirit friend and i enjoy the minor banters between the two but i suspect this can be a strong hit or miss for some people.To those who were put off by the reviews of the game but love the japanese folklore and characters, both horror related or not, you would most likely love the game. At best, you can always take advantage of Steam's 2 hour refund policy.

Tokyo is a very clean city where trash is deposited in appropriate receptacles, so it's very easy to find it. You can also get money by destroying ghostly money jars and ghostly lucky cat statues, which are everywhere. Another way to get money is absorbing spirits into little paper dolls (available from cursed shrines that you purify) and then uploading them to the internet from a payphone.

It is set in modern Tokyo; however, it comes with a major twist. Every single human disappears at the start of the game, leaving just their spirits behind. It is up to Akito who manages to survive with the help of a mysterious spirit calling himself KK. Thanks to him, Akito gains new supernatural powers needed to save both his sister from the clutches of Hannya as well as safe the city.Horrors UnleashedOn your journey through yokai-infested streets of Tokyo, you will meet various adversaries, called Visitors. These are pulled straight from Japanese folklore and urban legends. The most basic enemy, Rain Walker, is born because its human predecessor was drive to exhaustion by their work. And thus, in revenge, they drain life force from living and breathing humans. Every single enemy has a short backstory like this in the game, making you feel even more immersed. To face these evil entities, you are given your own arsenal of supernatural powers thank to KK’s ties to the spirit world. You have three basic abilities you unlock early on, each useful for different situations. There is the rapid-fire wind, explosive fire, and close-range water, each with their own supply of “ammunition”, which you replenish by breaking surrounding spirit objects. This whole set up forces you to be mobile in combat and never stand for too long in one spot otherwise you either risk being swarmed by enemies or running out of ammo. As there are ways to deal damage, there are some for avoiding damage. You can either dodge aside by simply moving or block the incoming attack. With precise timing, you can even get a perfect block, which negates all the damage. From personal experience, I can say that moving around is way more effective and safer than trying to block attacks coming from all sides. If you, however, do manage to get hit, do not fret. There is a hefty amount of healing items. Regular food not only heals you but also increases your overall max health, so eating is advised. Otherworldly food items give you temporary buffs to your skills or stats that diminish over time.On top of that, as you progress through the game, you will gain access to supportive talismans, which are one-use items that replace stereotypical FPS grenades. There are 4 distinctive types, again each useable in different scenario. Two of them are made for loud combat and two of them will make stealth easier. On topic of stealth, you have a few tools up your sleeve if you are a kind of player who enjoys sticking to the shadows and backstabbing everything alive. You can either get close and personal behind a Visitor, getting an easy kill (unless they are a tougher enemy or a boss) or use your trusty bow to snipe them from afar. The choice is ultimately up to you as well as is the playstyle. Collectathon in my open-world?!Ghostwire is not afraid to show its huge amount of collectable content within the game.  You have 240 thousand spirits to liberate, found in bunches ranging from 100 to 700. That is a lot of souls to save. You can get the spirits as quest rewards, find them in the open-world or through wave-based fights. All of these are collected by using katashiro (paper dolls), which cap at 50 and you start only with ten so get to upgrading them as fast as possible. After you get done with the spirits, there is a lot of relics for you to gather. Luckily, each of the collectors will mark the approximate location on the map if you tag in their respective shops, making it just a quick fetch quest for a decent amount of money and new unlocks when certain number of requests for each individual shopkeeper has been completed.So, you gather up all the relics and think for yourself that you are already done. Then you remember that a speaking tanuki gave you a quest to find 25 of his disguised friends. Those 25 tanukis transformed into everything ranging from billboards to cup of noodles. Luckily each of them has a tail sticking out, making them recognizable.You also have numerous magatamas either in shops or in form of yokai, who each have a different mini task attached to them. If you want to unlock every single skill in the game, you need to get all of them.On top of that you have outfits as well as music that can be played at any point in the game, making the exploration feel a bit more epic.In summary, massive chunk of content is collecting these items, so if you are not fan of gathering items and just running around the city, looking for all kinds of weird items, be vary. Why is this not Dying Light?Simple answer is lack of parkour moves. This game has jump button, simple climbing mechanics for getting on top of ledges, grappling hook and the ability to glide. To be completely objective here, the movement in Ghostwire does not feel nowhere as refined as in Dying Light. The climbing is often clunky and grabbing onto ledges changes into spamming spacebar after jumping. The fully upgraded grappling hook has unclear grapple points and again will result into you holding right click and mashing spacebar while aiming at the roof of a building to make sure you can grapple there. You simple cannot use the hook ability anywhere you wish to.However, this moveset is enough for you to make the exploration enjoyable. It was fun to glide across the Shibuya district with the tunes from the in-game musical player. Even with the rather simplistic mechanics, it was fun gathering up every single collectable. But do not expect the free-form movement that Dying Light offers.Akito + KK=BromanceThe duo of Akito and KK carried the story heavily. Their relationship that simply starts as KK being a parasite, sitting in Akito’s body developed into a closely tied friendship, where everything depends on utmost trust. I loved every single interaction between those two and was excited to see what new shenanigans the pair will bring to my screen. This was crucial as the overall narrative is very simplistic in nature. Evil man steals your sister and wants to connect the underworld with the human world. Normal Japanese anime stuff. Luckily for you, the main duo is stunning and almost never gets dull. If we exclude the repeated voice lines when it comes to side content. The same cannot be said about the supporting cast, which there is a few of. You do not get to know them a lot and it feels like they were placed in the game just it would not just be Akito and KK trying to stop Hannya’s evil schemes. Both Reiko and Ed, the rest of KK’s team are also spirits. Ed only talks through voice recordings when using the phone, whereas Reiko gets a bit of a screen time. Sadly, both characters are massively under-developed and feel like a fluff so the story would not feel entirely empty.Killing ghosts is easyAs with any game that has levels and character progression, if you do all the side content first, you will be massively overpowered. That made the end game bosses ridiculously easy. Don’t get me wrong, each of the major bosses has a unique and terrifying design with unique mechanics. However, those do not matter as you become a literal god amongst ghosts. That is my biggest issue with the game. I wish there would be any scaling in place or at least recommended levels for both the main quests and side-quests.

At the most surface level, its a sort of fusion of the best of the 2D Zelda games with a 'Souls-Like' combat system/philosophy.  That is you go around and explore, find new weapons and tools, unlock new areas with them, and then fight things with brutal and extremely punishing battle mechanics demanding split-second timing of dodge rolls and blocks.Of course, that is only the surface, if you dig down a little deeper you start to find the kind of ridiculously unraveling puzzles that games like The Witness are known for.  Suddenly you start looking at things you have been seeing all along your adventure but with new eyes which recognize hidden meanings, secrets, and all new ways to progress in the game in mechanics you didn't even know existed just before the discoveries.  Then you find even more secrets, even more new systems and methods of play and things really begin to unravel and rebuild in your mind in entirely new ways.And with all of that said, I have focused so much on the mechanics that I haven't even begun to describe the aesthetics.  The visuals are absolutely nothing short of one of the most stunning uses of stylized minimalist 3D that I have ever seen.  At times its so heavily stylized that you begin to lose track of it being 3D at all and it begins to look more like a carefully hand-crafted 2D world of the type that was seen in the heyday of early iPad type of games where things almost look painted and placed, only for your sense of the 3D world to come racing back when you dart around a corner and the camera/perspective does a relatively rare shift.The audio is similarly stunning and the ambient smooth music reminds me of the best of games like Fez where each area has its own theme and the music itself becomes part of the presence of each zone as you wander through it.  From melancholy soft melodies in abandoned ruins of cathedrals to relatively zen synth and almost chip tuney notes as you make your way through forests and gardens.Tying everything together is the in-game manual which has the perfect look and feel of the absolute best manuals of the 8 and 16 bit eras, subtly showing you mechanics and information in a mysterious language you can't hope to comprehend but with bright bubbly visuals and the pencil/pen notes of some unknown previous player to help guide you along.  You only gradually find and assemble the pages for this treasure and each one is a revelation that can open up entire new game mechanics you always had access to but simply did not know about.  The single most enjoyable treasure among so many in this game that you get to experience is the glimmer of yet one more new manual page on the screen which you can then greedily jump into and pore over, zooming in and out to unearth all the information, secrets, guidance, etc that it can have for you.Oh and the entire game is absolutely riddled with foxes among which your character is absolutely the cutest most inspirational and wonderful example and you cannot help but fall in love with their plucky little can-do attitude wonderfully emoted through every little movement and animation as they dart around and run through grass, fields, cliffs, water, etc.  No matter how brutally hard the game gets you can't help but dive back in to help this little fox get just a little further in their quest to... something something!In short yeah this game is honestly right up there in the hierarchy of some of the best indie games that have ever been created, among the company of Fez, The witness, Braid, etc.  Its an absolute treasure and whatever your personal gaming proclivities, you are doing yourself a dis-service if this does not make its way in to your library (and your head-space)."}, {"username": "YoungFool", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Unfortunately, you are illiterate."}, {"username": "SternOne", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Tunic is both rare and meticulous.Beautiful art design and a 'just-hard-enough' level of difficult combat combine well, as Tunic alights the imagination with a highly specific and unique reverence: one that speaks explicitly to the history of video games as a medium, what it was 'once like' to play them in a time lost to the ages, and what it was like to experience discovering a new one (lightly used). Once upon a time, people would rent video games from local retail stores. What came with any particular game, who could say. Sometimes, they would include instruction books with passwords left in the notes section. A Mega Man save image map, hand drawn.These traces were the remnants of a run through the game left unfinished, lost to its original player and time, now in your hands for the first time. Tunic is a game that simulates such a feeling, compelling in its player a simple truth, slowly: you are not the first. But here is what someone else has learned."}, {"username": "QuasimodosLump", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Really enjoyable and worth the wait. The game is being frequently described as a \"souls-like Link to the Past\" which I feel is unfair. While there are very immediate and central connections to LttP, I wouldn't describe souls-like as very apt. There is a death mechanic, a parry, and an upgrade system, but the vibe isn't at all like dark souls and outside of the parry, the other two similarities don't feel all that similar either. The difficulty isn't nearly as high or feel as punishing. I'd describe as slightly more difficult than casual. This game is very responsive, intuitive and holds a incredible amount of character. I had been following this game's development for maybe 6 or 7 years and in that span of time there have been a huge amount of games modeled on the link to the past format. I was worried that my experience would suffer from the market's oversaturation, but this game does an exceptional job of keeping you engaged and interested. The primary storytelling and mechanics-explaining vehicle is based on an in-game instruction manual that you pick up pieces of bit-by-bit and I love everything about it. There is so much attention to detail, a plethora of subtle/enticing hints, and puzzles that are legitimately difficult and frustrating that feel genuinely rewarding.This is probably the best game in the genre that I've played since Hyper Light Drifter. I'd suggest playing blind and really keeping yourself from looking up solutions when you are stuck. There are loads of 'ah-ha' moments that I wouldn't want you to spoil for yourself."}, {"username": "Swann", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Absolutely brilliant. TUNIC does an immaculate job of making each new discovery feel interesting, especially moments of \"wait, this was here the whole time!?\" The designer said something along the lines of \"this world doesn't care about you, and it exists without you...\" and it's the embrace of this design that lets the player uncover mysteries organically, without being railroaded into them. Then, in a game full of surprise after surprise, TUNIC's final puzzle sequences stands as one of the best I can remember experiencing in any game. The game is a visual treat with memorable locations & gorgeous animations, and a feast for the ears with tight sound design partnered with a picture-perfect OST by Lifeformed. TUNIC totally captures the imagination, and if you find yourself thinking about it long after shutting the game off, know that you're in good company! Highly recommended!"}, {"username": "MythicalRedFox", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "TUNIC is a beautifully crafted love letter to gaming itself; it wears its inspirations proudly on its sleeve, while simultaneously being an utterly unique experience.Highly recommended. People often compare it to The Legend of Zelda (particularly Link's Awakening, Link to the Past, etc.), combined with the combat difficulty of Dark Souls, and Fez-like puzzles; but while all that is true, it must be emphasised that the game has oodles of unique spins, features, and charms all of its own.Rarely have I played a game as enrapturing as this one. The wanderlust the game instils in you is addictive, the combat is challenging but highly, highly rewarding; the puzzles are tough, but make you feel like Sherlock Holmes when you finally do solve them.It's best played with an XBox controller, and going in as blind as possible. It's very easy to be spoiled on the game! There's secrets and hidden things everywhere, all over the place.The care and attention to detail in this game is astounding, and is truly a tour de force from the sole developer behind it. As someone who's been waiting for the game for all seven years of its development—someone who signed up for the mailing list back when it was still called \"Secret Legend,\" someone who played the demo of TUNIC all the way back at TwitchCon 2017—I can say that the wait was worth it.The soundtrack is fantastic, the art is beautiful, the gameplay is refined.Treat yourself to TUNIC.Side note: if you're a Vtuber, this is an excellent game to use dynamic Vtube lighting on!

With that out of the way, I want to tell you about my first dog Mud. Mud was the first dog that my friend and I bred in Wobbledogs. Short, wide, had a mess of scrawny legs that looked like spaghetti noodles. I chose him because he was funny looking. Then, as it turns out, he couldn't walk. He only had three of those spaghetti noodle legs. This led to me having to take care of him once every minute or two. Bringing food for him to eat, scratching him so he felt better, or telling him to sleep. Mud became a huge thorn in my side.When my first dog died, I fed Mud the core because I didn't know what it did and was just messing around. Turns out, it extends your dog's life, so I sighed, knowing I'd have to put up with him for even longer. I was wanting Mud to die so I could stop having to care for him so often, and I'd just unknowingly extended the waiting game. Finally, I got the notification that Mud was going to die soon. But, instead of the relief I thought I would feel, I felt sad. I did not want to lose Mud anymore. He had been around for so long. Sure, I had to care for him every minute or two, but he has been with me, through thick and thin. I fed Mud another core, and I have two more in storage for him. He has his own room now, with a TV, speakers, fire place, a Den all to himself, and more. I will give Mud the life he deserves.

I do not negatively review flippantly, and do so reluctantly. But I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, except to a highly select audience.I give Visual Concepts credit where it's due. They've inherited a series from a dev team who worked on it for decades, and during some very difficult circumstances, managed to produce a reasonably functional and stable game that does an arguably acceptable job of exploiting the series' strengths while adding some interesting twists to the formula. And they did this after taking two and a half years off following the troubled launch of WWE 2K20, to try to get it right. I commend them for that, and for creating what is a reasonably enjoyable experience when it works.The new MyGM mode, though limited compared to classic GM modes, has been a surprise standout for me. Setting it up, trying to figure out what will get the highest ratings, and managing a show budget are unexpectedly addictive.This year's Showcase, a historical career retrospective focusing on Rey Mysterio that stretches from WCW to his current stint with his son Dominik, is fun and doesn't overstay its welcome. Transitions between archival video footage and angle-perfect gameplay in that mode are a fantastic presentational touch. Along with the period-accurate visual filters and lighting used in many of those venues and broadcasts.While not a fan of combos, and most of what's on offer here is a mere reshuffling of states and actions with different inputs, the new control scheme is likely beginner-friendlier.Each of the game's modes - from the card collecting MyFaction, to MyGM's management options, to Universe Mode's full micromanagement of everything, to MyRise's branching career mode - feels distinct, self-contained, and in and of themselves fun. Unfortunately, a lack of cross-mode integration was step one in my inexorable spiral toward frustration. I spend a lot of time in these games' creation modes. I spent days carefully creating my custom CAS, which I planned to use in MyRise. Maddeningly, that's not something 2K22 permits. You cannot import a created superstar into MyRise. Nor can you export your MyRise character to other modes.Putting care and effort into a CAS is a sizable time investment. Having no way to use them in this game's career mode is simply not a user-friendly design. Recreating them entirely for MyRise is just as bad.I ended up making a cartoonish CAS I threw together in moments instead, because it simply wasn't worth the effort.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784244540I then moved onto MyFaction. I found it enjoyable. You create a deck of cards representing specific superstars, and then play them in matches to level them up and unlock additional cards. Some cards reveal otherwise inaccessible superstars, such as classic versions of characters. Except... yet again... these unlockable characters cannot be used outside of MyFaction. It's counterintuitive, and killed any sense of payoff for grinding.These odd limitations litter the game. There are no mid-card titles in MyGM Mode (and while tag team titles were added as of v1.09, they are available only on certain difficulties.) Promos have been removed from Universe Mode. This year's custom entrances are far simpler affairs, with many important options gutted entirely, supposedly to avoid issues present in 2k20.And unfortunately, that brings me to my single biggest issue with this release. \"It hits different!\" That's 2K22's slogan. \"Redesigned engine.\" These are things you can read on storefronts. Yet while more stable overall, the game is packed with the same legacy issues that have plagued the series for years. And some new ones. The title screen failed to acknowledge any input for nearly 40 seconds if I downloaded too many community creations. Load times when using created superstars and arenas grew to 4 minutes. There is clipping through body parts during entrances, despite tight limits being placed on entrance creation and other measures supposedly introduced to avoid this. Hair looks and animates just as jankily and rough as ever. Many In-game superstar faces look less accurate than community creations do.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2788025464Online play is marred by lag and disconnects (which costs rewards.) There's no variable refresh rate support. As of v1.09, display resolution cannot be set above native (e.g. no DSR.) Altering attires for existing superstars introduces permanent geometry warping on certain in-game models. As in 2K20 there is a soft limit on total user created images before issues emerge. Once exceeded, images on downloaded wrestlers simply vanish. Nothing warns players of this. I worked for days on a CAS only for one eye to become permanently frozen (more wasted time, & this is an old bug.) Universe is buggy (custom arenas don't save to shows consistently, invisible wrestlers attack you, titles don't change hands as cutscenes say they have, etc.) Bugged custom belts are blank.Then there is the UI and general user experience. The editor has flashing selection highlights that cover fine details and can't be disabled. Minor accessibility features enabled by users don't work online. UI leaves some players uncertain what to do in MyRise. You can climb to the top of ladders and leap off inside the ring, but not outside it. HIAC (and other) throws feel hit or miss.Worst of all: I lost 100+ hours of progress & creation work to a simple reinstall. (Manually back up your saves, people.)ConclusionWWE 2K22 is a game I wanted to love and I have the hours to prove it. I'll likely continue the struggle to extract enjoyment from it. But in its current state it doesn't feel like it respects my time, money, or intelligence. For every moment of fun, there is a frustrating restriction or technical flaw that makes it a grind to get the most out of. There have been some very high profile \"worst launches ever\" in recent years. Yet those games were islands of functionality and stability in comparison to this one. They got hate-trained, while actual broken annualized sports IPs get a pass year after year. Enough is enough.I've played this series for 22 years. This is now the third time a return to form has been implied in some way.

The goal is to travel to all points of interest and make a picture.The game has a late 90s PC/Playstation aesthetic, but where it really shines is the sound design.

The setting tells it all. You're alone, navigating a small submarine in a blood ocean on an alien moon. You can't look out of the window, only take snapshots with your camera.There is no marker on your map so you'll have to navigate via coordinates. I actually liked this idea and the game itself isn't so long that it starts to get tedious. You'll have to take a certain number of pictures to complete your mission. An alarm is kicking off when you're getting to close to a wall - and it never stops until you're increased the space inbetween. The sense of danger, of dread and the classic fear of that what lurks in the dark and can't be seen - yet heard - makes this little game very special. The soundeffects are very disturbing and well placed, making your claustrophobic situation even worse.

Most notably, Thief Simulator, which was released a couple of years ago. So perhaps you can consider this game the third-person version of it.If you have not played that like myself let's continue! You play as Jack who ends up in the prison of a small town following an awful heist. As somebody wants you free you are given the key to your cell and asked to escape, get to a motel and also to get your towed car. These first couple of missions can be considered the tutorial of the game.After that you end up in Bar 66 where you meet Stacks. He'll give you a lot of missions and following his storyline is the way to complete the Prologue. Now, what are these missions? They are jobs and are all about stealing something. It can be a precious guitar or just a special whiskey some consider invaluable. You are free to explore the town in a Grand Theft Auto-like fashion meaning you can always hop in your vehicle and drive around as you see fit. The best of the game for me was the preparatory session. Each job (or robbery) requires careful planning. The game keeps feeding you with tips as more and more items or tools become available. You learn how to disguise yourself as an electrician, how to sneak, enter with the use of a hammer or crowbar and how to escape the police. You need to see a corrupt cop to get your heat lowered following a couple of busted heists. Now, just because your mission objective is one particular item it doesn't mean you can't steal other stuff. Bigger devices such as microwave ovens or TVs can also be picked up and put in the trunk of your car. Be on the lookout for parking spaces as they allow you to change your clothes and also to sleep: sleeping is essential as if there are no or fewer tenants in a house your job will be significantly easier. Jack's ability to get better at running or have a bigger backpack all can improved in the form of skills. After each heist you get an evaluation and provided that you were not noticed and that you left with a full backpack you can get a very high score which can also yield you 50% plus XP.I completed the free Prologue and did not have the chance to use any lockpick tools. Also, there are some options in your inventory menu that are inactive. In the full game we'll probably be able to purchase real estate and also new vehicles.

Similar to Thief Simulator, you find yourself at the mercy of individuals who hold your life in their hands and to get it back you must use your god given thieving talents to steal everything that isn't nailed down with leg warmers.THE GOOD:+ It's Thief Simulator - if you enjoy stalking, snatching and running for your life when it all goes wrong, this is for you.+ Small mini-games when using your tools to unlock, break or jimmy things open.+ The 1980s! See marvelous artifacts in history such as the cassette tapes, the VCR, the WALKMAN, and the CRT Television.  Don't let their arcane appearance fool you! Steal that ♥♥♥♥!+ The demo offered a single neighborhood that had a few places to revisit and plunder.  Additionally, with the bar contacts you're able to pick up a couple of sub quests that help you along your thieving path.THE BAD- Remember, it's an indie title. If you're looking for Red Dead Redemption 2 level interaction, you need to look elsewhere. This is a simple concept of scope, sneak, steal, slide on outta there. Even beyond the demo, it's very unlikely it'll reach that level simply due to budget and development team.   Approach with that in mind and you're good. - the AI seems more tolerant than the one found in Thief Simulator.  I understand that the change in attire will make me very difficult to spot, but if I sneak pass a resident within arms length and they become alerted it probably shouldn't take me moving behind a crate to immediately put them at ease.- Possibly just due to it being a demo: The NPCs in the area are pretty much mindless dolls that walk around and don't quite react to you the way actual people would.  They will react if they see you wearing clothing suitable for stealing things, or if you're rockin' that magnavox across the street to your junker of a car, but if you block them they simply stare into your wretched soul and wait for you to move off their pathing. THE UGLY~ Visually superior to Thief Simulator - but its pretty hard to see with the bloom up as high as they have it.  Everything glows and/or has this very surreal look.  It's not a deal breaker for me, but toning it down somewhat may allow the textures to really shine through.

The graphics and models are bad and feel like a hodgepodge of pre-created assets that have been bought from the Unity Asset Store and inserted into the game. It doesn't feel coherent in any way.Aliasing is terrible even at 4k resolution with AA turned on, which is not acceptable in 2022. Settings don't save when you quit the game. Other issues like this throughout the game. So many rough edges.Merely moving forward feels clunky in first person with an extremely jarring and awkward view bob. Interacting with anything feels equally as bad and janky. Doors are just flaps that move back and forth when you walk into them. Why? It feels terrible. Everything I did in my limited playtime felt BAD. Everything.For a game that relies on stealth (and therefore fine control of your positioning and feedback from the environment), this level of jank and lack of control is a total deal-breaker. It feels clumsier in every way than Thief Simulator, and I felt that Thief Simulator was just barely tolerable as it was, with its many issues with being spotted through walls and other frustrating gameplay quirks.Maybe some of this will be ironed out by release, but any intention I had of purchasing the game has gone up in smoke with the poor state of this demo."}, {"username": "Plexy", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Pretty cool game.

If a platform is 0.5 inches higher than you, you have to jump to get on it.- You have to look DIRECTLY at something to interact with it. Want to get in you car? Try looking at the car. Not working? Try looking at the driver's side door. STILL not working? Try looking specifically at the handle. I don't know what reason they forced this precision, but it doesn't add to the enjoyment or immersion.- Movement is jerky to start when you press the buttons and slowly trundles to a stop when you let go. Other games manage to make you feel like you have momentum without it being so uncomfortable.I'm glad to see they've improved a lot over the first game. A lot of interactions are a lot cleaner. You can see how full an item will make your backpack. Looking at an NPC will show you their schedule. All of the fine details have been polished somewhat.The graphics are a lot better too, but that was never what made the original game feel good.They've managed to keep that addictive core of sneaking around people's houses and sticky-fingering lots of little valuables, and I'm glad they haven't lost the core of their enjoyment. But if they can't fix basic movement issues from the first game, I'm not going to spend money to buy the same problems a 2nd time.I appreciate that they made a demo available, however. Tempted to buy this when it comes out just to encourage that practice. It takes balls to put out what you have for free before you have people's money in your grip."}, {"username": "KayJay", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Woof, where to start... This game needs a LOT of work still.  Animations feel incredibly bad, NPCs seem oblivious, and overall it just feels far worse to play than Thief Simulator.  Voice acting is... very rough, visually it looks like a game from the mid 2000s, and while I appreciate some of the gameplay changes, it just doesn't feel good to play.I think they nailed the aesthetic they were going for, but if this is an accurate preview to the game itself, it still needs a year+ in the oven still.EDIT: Biggest thing I forgot to mention that the devs NEED to address: Doors.  The doors SHOULD NOT operate just by walking through them.  Being able to actually open/shut doors is a pretty important aspect of stealth games.  Not being able to see through a doorway unless you're physically pushing the door open is such a monumentally bad change from Thief Simulator."}, {"username": "kixxu", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "no way gta 6"}, {"username": "Liber  Primus", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "WHEN WILL IT BE RELEASED!!!

The games art is awesome, the battles change every game, and the fear creatures are very unique. The game at first sight might look simple but it actually gets more complex as you play. Its also nice that this game is very free to play but it of course as all games do has a pay to win aspect. You can also play with friends and play 10 games at once and come back to them whenever you want which makes it really easy to play on your own time. If your looking for a strategy card game I would say this is one of the best ones out there and I have played A LOT. Overall this game definitely deserves a 9/10.Updated (I wanted to update my review on the game after 30 hours of game play)PROS:1.The game is very polished but could use some additions (noted below)2.The rewards received from jacks (reward system) and quests are scaled nicely3.Allows players to play against friends and even complete quests in friend battles (great feature)4.Allows for asynchronous playing and live play (each player in live seems to get a minute per turn)5. Art/animations/music is great6.The game is very intricate and new from any other game I've seenCONS:1.Game can seem pay to win if your cards are vastly under leveled. (But its understandable when a company needs to make money somehow, this aspect should be expected in virtually every game)2.In the live matches (arena mode) when you click your unit (fear) to move to a hex if the time runs out it stops where they are and doesn't continue the motion. (not sure if this is a bug or just a problem I found personally)3.There is a cap on resources (tears and experience) if you continue playing. (resets daily)4.The progression for obtaining coffee is to low, there should be ways to get more of it (maybe clan battles mentioned below)5.Some cards definitely seem way more utilized than others making other cards rarely if not never used.6.When you obtain to many cards there is no deck feature to remove unnecessary scrolling in battleADDITIONS:-Game needs a clan system of some sort with donations, clan wars, friendly battles, chat, etc.-Game needs emotes in both the asynchronous and especially the arena mode. (For asynchronous it could be to send out one emote per turn)-Game needs either a monthly or weekly tournament that players can enter for rewards-The game DEFINITELY needs a daily log in reward system to keep players coming back-Game NEEDS to uncap resources (tears and experience) even at a lesser amount is fine, but when a player keeps playing and there is no rewards beside coffee (resource) it feels very unrewarding. -There should be 2 re-rolls for quests daily instead of oneMy Thoughts:This game is one of the few games that doesn't have a battle pass and I applaud them for it. If they do include this aspect they should definitely keep it free. I think this game is fantastic and definitely needs some more attention from some of the big streamers to make it really shine. It has all the aspects to be a great game, but without all the additions I have mentioned this game will surely lose interest. If I could say this game was like anything else its like a mash up of Clash Royale, Legends of Runeterra, and Team Fight Tactics (of course there are other games but these are the ones that come to the top of the list for me). So after more hours under my belt i'm going to give this game a 8.2/10 because it has a huge room for improvement and if those additions are made it will no doubt become a 10/10."}, {"username": "Gustov Brokenwind", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "This is a fun concept and well executed game. However, it's standard pay to win garbage in progression. Monetization is set so that those with spare cash can bully everyone else. Those that spend little cannot progress due to very low daily resource caps and RNG based card pulls.I was rocking 80%+ win rate in both async and arena then suddenly starting getting matched with \"players\" that clearly bought their way to the top.  Strategy only gets you so far when you literally cannot kill their cards as intended with their counters due to stat hikes.  Huge player level differences are not fun. This is supposed to be a strat game, not do your best until someone's bank account kills you.

Very chess like; there is no random, all the numbers and values for you and your enemy are all laid out. You can read each enemy unit cards and see what they can do. No surprises aside from strategies you didn't think of. This is a game where you can really win from planning out many moves ahead, no matter what units you have. I've played against better players than me that won with, what seemed way worse units than I had out.Collecting all the monsters \"Phobies\" is also very addictive, you get new pieces that can really alter your strategy and the outcome of the game. The plays become an art and your strategy becomes a beautiful masterpiece, just like chess.Aside from that, this game is very polished. No bugs that I can think of (or seen yet), everything is very fluid and responsive. Well placed effects, pure eye candy for the most part.Edit: - I see a lot of reviews talking about this game as if it was only async; If you are looking for a non-async experience. There is arena mode, which is playing a full game right away against your opponent. You get 1 min (roughly i haven't counted) to do your turn and it flows quite well. I'm hoping to see tournaments in the future- I know some people wont like the pay model, however, to me its very similar to MTG. Except even better because you don't need new cards to win or stay competitive. But the choice is there and if you feel like being a collector and buy a few packs once in a while, you have that option. AFAIK server infrastructure to keep a multiplayer game alive, isn't exactly cheap, yet these guys are letting us play the full game for free. You even get new monsters from buying packs with the soft currency that you get from just playing. It just takes longer to get all the monster that way, which I think is fair."}]}, {"game_id": "1902490", "game_title": "Aperture_Desk_Job", "overall_score": "- 92% of the 1,256 user reviews in the last 30 days are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Free to Play", "Singleplayer", "Funny", "Casual", "Action", "3D", "Simulation", "Comedy", "Cinematic", "Robots", "Story Rich", "Shooter", "Artificial Intelligence", "Family Friendly", "On-Rails Shooter", "Controller", "Adventure", "Short", "First-Person", "Psychological Horror"], "reviews": [{"username": "Austin", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Better than battlefield 2042"}, {"username": "Aphrodite", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "A literal game about weaponized toilets I love it"}, {"username": "Kuldz", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Valve, give us Portal 3, please"}, {"username": "berkanov dayakci", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "it's a 30min demo for steam deck but still better than cyberpunk2077"}, {"username": "Dr. Permixtus", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Short but charming, not much more to say.

I also think it's odd that no-one appears to have tried this title. It's not THAT bad. That said, it didn't grab me personally and I think what is here is overpriced. It's worth something like $5.The combat here is turn based, similar to Master of Magic or Age of Wonders if you've ever played those. You move the units one square at a time. You've got 2 ranks of 4 that you have to fill up with units, and then you engage 8 enemy units in battle. You start right up against each other, no maneuvering.I don't know, there's a variety of units - horse archer, cavalry, infantry, an offensive spell class, and archers, but you don't get a lot of sense of contrast between them. Cavalry can only move one square just like infantry. You charge down a group of spellcasters in the enemy back row and you take as many casualties as they do. You also can't pick what units you have. You start with 2 infantry, a cavalry, I think 3 horse archers, 2 archers and 'witches', who are your casters. There's also a 'spy' in reserve. But with that force, you're going to have at least one group in the front row who shouldn't be in the front row, and if there's a way to buy new units and swap them out, I didn't see it.The UI feels rough and there are some glitches, like in the battle I fought there was a text message saying something like, \"Start battle\" and it remained on the screen the whole time. That's EA stuff, but I have to mention it.I didn't play long enough to really try out the Roguelike and Campaign aspects of the game, as the battle and army setup didn't draw me in enough to keep playing.If the dev keeps working on this, and say, creates a greater flexibility in the units you can field, a larger battlefield so you can manuever, smooths out the UI, so you've got a battle that is more like Master of Magic. And then has a good Roguelike/campaign mode I can see this being a decent title and worth $11.

to see gameplay, this is my experience with the game: https://youtu.be/_4LAAmq3w7oMy Review:This is a great little game and it'll take you about an hour to finish it. There are some flawed design choices in that there's quite a bit of trial and error with the puzzles and a lack of direction for the first 10 minutes or so. A lot of the confusion comes from the character not adequately describing the world around him when he interacts with stuff. For example, there is a moment in which the character is looking for an item to fix a pipe under the sink. You could have interacted with everything in the house leading up to that point with no mentions of a wrench or anything, so naturally you'll start examining every interactable in the house again. It can feel a bit tedious if you don't catch these things the first time around.Another issue is that because of the pixelated graphics, a lot of the items you need may blend into the background a little too well. That same wrench you'll be looking for is hidden in plain sight, and there will come a time where you'll need a sledgehammer but it'll look like it's part of a shelf so you might miss it and wonder what you have to do and it leads to frustration.As for the positives, this is a great looking game. The rotoscope animations are great, visceral, and incredibly fun to watch unless you're watching it over and over again because you couldn't find the sledgehammer. I didn't run into any bugs and I walked into just about every wall there is in this game looking for the 2nd ending so I'll go ahead and say that this is essentially a completely bug-free game. The music is retro-inspired and works really well with everything that's going on. There's one track that I dislike, but only because I had to listen to it for 10 minutes while walking around the backyard since there is no sprint button. There are a few messages that were missed by the developer and not translated to English but I don't think those messages were a big deal so it's fine. I couldn't find the 2nd ending despite numerous playthroughs of me interacting with every single thing, every single chance I got, multiple times. It's either incredibly hidden or I'm missing something completely obvious and that's a little frustrating because I can't tell with this game due to the issues it has.It cost a dollar at the time of my purchase so It was well-worth it for me, even with the design issues. I'm only being more critical of this game because I believe in the developers ability to grow.

I enjoy this game a lot despite its flaws as these can be easily fixed. To me, it has so many functions that make the game much more interesting than Among Us.Positives:• Day and Night cycle: During the night you cannot use the lookout tower (cams), cannot ring the bell to call a meeting, and vision is reducedWhy is that a positive? It adds dynamic to the game for the killers and brings back the same chills like the nights in ToS give you as a veteran or survivor.• 30 (28) unique roles: Each of these roles do their own respective thing, while some will feel stronger than others, the roles are randomly given so you are simply required to work together and several roles are just very strong in combination with each other!• Traitors: Playing as a traitor is insanely fun! You get so many abilities to use and change the game, it can be very very difficult for the town to do anything if you play your cards right!Cons:• It is early access so it has a bunch of bugs and some things don't feel as good buuut it will get tweaked so that will only be temporary!• The Meeting is .. Very very short at the moment, you get barely any time to discuss, the games go by so fast and there are too many roles to make it understandable, especially when first starting to play.• No tutorial or proper explanations: Each game I find so many new players asking where to do certain tasks and or what their role is doing despite there being a small card. The devs said they will add the option to see each role in the menu probably through options on what they are doing so that will only be temporary. However, as a new player, expect your first 10 games to be very confusing as you have no idea what is going on (Tip: You can click on the task on the top left to see a marker lead you to where you have to go! Also with M you can check the Map)Last few words:So you got to the end of this little thing, while I gave some big Cons, keep in mind these are going to change very likely and I would still very much recommend the game as it just is a lot of fun even simply figuring out or finally getting a fun role. Some roles feel counterproductive and bad but once you understand them they can be super strong (Saint as an example is a role that sounds bad but is one of the strongest in the game!)It is a social deduction game so you will have to deal with trolls and toxic players at times but that is expected with every multiplayer game and thus far they have been rare.I am very excited to see where this game will develop in the future and what more may be added.

Devs in the forums already said that's harder to balance as there's only two teams right now (no mafia, no coven, all the evils currently implemented are on the same team).  All/Any was my favorite mode to play in ToS because of the chaos it brings, and makes it easier to lie.Needs some maps, and quickly.

It is much more fast paced and goofy (especially in voice) but has less strategic elements the original TOS had. Long version: The game has many fun or overpowered roles with a few weaker/boring ones but they're outshined by a mile. The background designs and map are in 2.5D, and are visually ok, a combination of old TOS and some fantasy cartoony stuff (I hope more maps are added in the future however).The voice mode for traitors in salem is integrated seamlessly and actually fills in a niche that TOS was lacking (since text is a disadvantage alot of the time). Proximity chat exists and is pretty good however there needs to be individual sound bars for each player (some are loud af and some are 10 miles away from their mic). I have encountered very few bugs such as dc'ing mid lynch or game and then joining a new one can cause a weird glitch where all the game UI is messed up and you can phase. Few Pros:More roles than other Among us like games (and more roles than TOS?)Lots of variation and customisation in games (However classic mode can become stale overtime with the same people)Fun with strangers due to the voice chat optionFor me currency has been seemingly easy to get (without paying irl money)Few Cons: Sometimes the FPS can be dodgy but I haven't felt it much'Vents' are wayyy more risky and not worth using alot of the time The 'cameras' aka telescopes are pretty strong...no indication your being watched UI can feel clunky and slow at times (and the noise is hella loud especially for being lynched)Needs:TutorialA friend's list/way to add peopleIndividual player volume optionsMaybe a proper dead chat to type in 24/7 while a ghost?More task variation (not same 3 ones)More gamemodes or some more traitor variation in the classic listJailor."}, {"username": "Necrie", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "An extremely fun deception game with a variety of fun roles and gorgeous designs set in a 2.5d world.

Voice recognition is mostly seamless and they also include proximity voice chat for when you are ingame. However one thing I recommend is being able to tell who is speaking more easily when you are in discussion phase by lighting up their entire row rather than just the circle with the avatar in it. Regarding how smooth the game plays with public, I have not yet to encounter many bugs (with the exception of clipping, but not something you can do by accident at all.) Played a mix of town and traitor roles, all roles I played seem to work without problems and seem mostly balanced for now with the exception of cultist when paired with other traitors.

Isn't this just a blatant rip off of Among Us? Well, let me bring up a few notes before getting into the actual review section. First off, Among Us could be argued to be a copy of Town of Salem which is from the developers of this game. Second off, there are many games styled similarly but have different aspects than Among Us, like Project Winter, Goose Goose Duck, and plenty of others. This is one of those games. Before you judge it I would suggest you at least try the game before doing so!Now onto my actual thoughts of the game itself. BlankMediaGames have really outdone themselves with the Alpha process of the game. With 31 unique roles all resembling their former Town of Salem roles, many returning characters with skins as well, and built in Proximity Chat, the doors that this game have are endless. Originally going into it, I was thinking two things, one that of course, the trailer and reveals make it look almost identical to Among Us because it was a pre-alpha build that was shown, and two that it had lots of potential to become something significantly better than Among Us. Many of the improvements and additions have been a result of the devs taking feedback from the community. I know I probably had a big part in getting proximity chat because that's the only thing I would tell Traitor Rus (one of the game developers) to do!Aside from the 31 unique roles, Traitors in Salem also has Traitor Spells which differ from the reactor and O2 limited Among Us impostor abilities. There's also the addition of Boons which give you a temporary or permanent buff for the entirety of that game. On top of a vast map, there are many ways you can fast travel between different points of the map other than just your feet. The map is also dynamic in the sense that traitors can cut off certain routes from being able to be used!In the few months I created content for and saw this game grow and take advise from the community which is something that is rarely seen from many developers, you can really only make up your mind once you play it. No matter how much the game costs, it is well worth it and suits many different play styles (VC on vs off), being probably the best quick way to burn a solid 5-10 minutes of your time while also having fun. Plus, as it's an early access game, you know that there is so much more content in the works behind the scenes that will just add to your investment as time goes on. Here's to a big launch! You should definitely get it, the game is great. - ShadowDior"}]}, {"game_id": "1851280", "game_title": "Samurai_Bringer", "overall_score": "- 88% of the 294 user reviews for this game are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Action", "Hack and Slash", "Character Customization", "Action RPG", "Dungeon Crawler", "Action Roguelike", "Roguelite", "2.5D", "Action-Adventure", "Mythology", "Isometric", "Top-Down", "Lore-Rich", "Ninja", "Historical", "Procedural Generation", "Singleplayer", "Cute", "Pixel Graphics", "Cartoon"], "reviews": [{"username": "ElfLeaderMike", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "While there's an interesting high speed hack and slash game in here somewhere.

Super floaty and there's no weight behind your attacks. Every attack ends in a long recovery idle that makes even the most basic attacks/combos feel clunky.Bosses \"guard\" all normal attacks, so you have to time your move to when they are about to attack, but it doesn't stagger them or anything, and every time they hit you, you're going to get stunned for 10 seconds.You cannot aim with your mouse, which I would greatly prefer to a controller.If that description doesn't turn you away, and you liked what you saw on the trailer you will like it.But for me it's a 2/5."}, {"username": "Chalkbot", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "This game is good.Just saw a bunch of reviews complaining about not being able to rebind the controls.

I can't tell you how much content there is or will be but from just playing for half an hour there is ALOT of polish here.The music, art, sound and general gameplay are all excellent, and amazing at this price point. The upgrading system seems fun and they have really nailed the feedback when slicing down loads of enemies. I honestly think you could make a diablo style campaign with these mechanics and I wouldn't have any problem playing through it with these gameplay mechanics alone. I really feel like the only thing that would be able to hold this game back would be a lack of content, as in bosses, enemies, tilesets and so on, but as I've played way to little to comment on that I'll update my review when I know more. It's also incredibly important to note that this game is CHEAP, so even if there does not turn out to be a whole lot of content the game is well worth it, 8€ for this amount of polish and character is insane.Now onto my few gripes from playing an extremely short amount of time, these might be addressed by playing the game more or mechanics I have not yet discovered so please take these with a grain of salt, I do hope the developers reads this though.- Boss/Miniboss Health seems really really high, this might be due to me just having started the game but I really think this is quite bad for a roguelite. Feeling like battles are determined by skill and not attrition is what makes roguelikes addictive in my opinion, having bulletsponges in roguelikes is really REALLY boring in my opinion. This is after the tutorial mind you, I am not talking about the first tutorial boss I am talking about the named \"minibosses\" that are in some levels.- Stunlock is also not a fun mechanic, there might be a way to get out these and there probably is when I've unlocked more scrolls but I feel it's important to note. It feels like if I get hit by the first hit in a 3 hit combo I need to stay there for all three, might get fixed later, still not a fun mechanic regardless, I would love to be able to dash out of these if atleast my reactions are good.- Being able to retreat feels really lame, I think you should aim at designing encounters that feel fair, giving the player the ability to retreat just feels like a bandaid for some encounters being unfair. I am NOT telling you to make the game easy but if you make me be able to win each encounter without trying to kill a bulletsponge for 5 minutes with really low damage I don't need to be able to retreat.

Sadly, it trips up due to its steep learning curve of complexity that prevents you from jumping right in for murderous fun, is hampered by vague tutorials, a handbook that has somewhat out-of-date videos, and missing tool-tips in the Resource tab of the editor. Conditionally Not Recommended with a warning this won't be an easy-jump-in like other sandbox games similar in design.   Detailed review follows:ACTION SANDBOX (AS) is the latest addition to the comically dark, adult-orientated sandbox collection of being your own Paul Bernado or Jeffery Dalmer. You can create environments where sim-people can either ride machines of mass destruction, be mangled by machines of mass destruction, or ride machines of mass destruction to mangle other sim-people riding machines of mass destruction. In fact, where it stands out from its cousins People Playground and Mutilate-A-Doll, you have an actual editor to construct the environments and populate it with things you create before actually deploying it in the field. In that editor you can assign word balloons for your sim-people to say and sounds for them to make, connect automation controls consisting of logic gates, sensors,and wires; camera controls to adjust the scene as the environment plays out, and select from a large inventory of items to assemble things. You can even colourize the items.I had some reservations about purchasing this because I currently have an i3-8th generation laptop with only 8 gig of RAM and Intel UHD graphics, but to my surprise it runs better than I thought, with a frame rate per second that is higher than People Playground. What ultimately takes the shine out of this is the presentation. Like one fictional Starfleet chief engineer quipped to another fictional Starfleet chief medical officer, \"the more complex the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain\". AS falls far short of explaining how to do things in the sandbox. The five-step tutorial adopts a show-don't-tell approach with previews that as a little hard to follow due to speed and the size of the objects and text in the preview window (be prepared to squint). I had to bluff my way through part 4 and 5 of it because it wasn't so clear on what to do. The handbook, which contains more detailed information on what to do through additional but thankfully larger windowed show-don't-tell videos, is locked until you complete the tutorial. That's wrong in my opinion. The handbook should be available regardless of whether the user does the tutorial or not. Regarding the handbook itself, there are some videos that do not match the game features, so if you're wondering if you are having comprehension and memory retention issues after watching them, relax. You're not going senile.The context menus are poorly worded, and the font on them is VERY small. You can make it more readable by lowering the resolution at the expense of screen real estate. There are missing tool-tips in the resource tab of the object collection so if you want to figure out what these parts are, just drop them in either the edit or play mode. Some aspects of the object collection make it hard to find to create custom sim-people and I've yet to figure out how to reshape both body parts and objects. It's like the game is trying it's hardest to hide stuff from me. This is one of these offerings that I was really stuck on what recommendation to give, and wish Steam could give something more than just a binary choice. If you're like me who wants things clearly explained with minimal guesswork and in manageable chunks, I think you should stick with either People Playground or Mutilate-A-Doll despite their presentation and design not being as robust, since you can get into the action of play much quicker. I've been at this for hours now and still am confounded on what to do with some things and for that reason I'm going to give this a Conditional Not-Recommended. That however can change over time to a \"Recommended\" if the game, which admittedly has just come out, changes to become easier to handle. I do have some suggestions to the dev on how to make the game easier to work with. The first is to throw out the five-part tutorial and replace it with the unlocked access to the handbook. I'd also like the handbook to be updated to reflect the current game features, and with spoken voiceover. Make the font adjustable in size regardless of the resolution. Add tool-tips to the resource tab objects so we don't have to guess what some of those objects are."}]}, {"game_id": "1582680", "game_title": "Trolley_Problem_Inc", "overall_score": "- 63% of the 174 user reviews for this game are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Choices Matter", "Indie", "Dark Humor", "Life Sim", "Casual", "Simulation", "Immersive Sim", "Minimalist", "Text-Based", "Artificial Intelligence", "Capitalism", "Comedy", "Education", "Funny", "Philosophical", "Singleplayer", "Satire", "Surreal", "Underground", "Co-op"], "reviews": [{"username": "GamerTommy", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "\"A game you purchase on sale for $9.89 USD promises to provide an interesting take on the Trolley Problem, a classic ethical dilemma.

It doesn't feel like choices really matter. The narrator belittles you continously, which could be done in a fun way, or actually provoce some reflection, but she continously gets my reasoning for choices completely wrong.In the end it is simply irritating and to expensive for what it is, if you want to actually work with problems like these, but ones that actually make sense there are plenty of sources out there, most of them even being free."}, {"username": "Tewiemitsu", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "*Note that I have only played single-player.Firstly, I think this game does do some good things:- It's good for a bit of mental stimulation and informing the player about relevant philosophers based on the questions being asked. - I think it'd be a fun enough game to play with your friends once or maybe twice. - The game has moment of creativity with it's visuals, and although simplistic at times looks nice.- As I put below the game has it's faults and stumbles here and there, I think at it's heart the developers tried something a little bit different with this game so props for that.- It's a cool feature to see what people voted for after you answer the questions, definitely would not have been as interesting without this.However, there are also some problems I have with the game:- I think the price for what amounts to 1-2 hours of content is not completely unreasonable, but perhaps a bit on the higher side. Pick this up on sale if it's not a big deal to you, I also think it'd be hard to persuade a group of friends that you wanted to play this to buy this for what is quite a short game.- I thought the game might be funnier and inject humour and fun into these thought experiments and philosophical questions and I don't think it did that, but tbf perhaps that wasn't it's aim and comedy is subjective- The game's overall conclusion and core message is that often times we don't have a choice, that is that we are put into positions where we have to choose the options available to us but being in that position might not have been something we chose. In this sense it questions our free will, it also show's that sometimes you can make what you think is the best decision available to you with the information you have and that can still be the wrong decision. I think people who are complaining about the lack of real choice, perhaps miss that it seems to be part of the game, I could be wrong but I think that was probably intentional by the developers. Although I think it might be easy to look at a game about making decisions and to think that those decisions will actually mean something or significantly change the game, so if you're looking for that, this game isn't really that. - My problem though, is that the ideas at the heart of this philosophy focused game are kind of a basic concept, that the game doesn't really go that deep into. As a result it's commentary on different issues and ideas, which it definitely has, felt a bit basic to me at the end of my run. At one point the game even admits that this message is unsubtle, when it gives you the option to either a) kill a person, or b) kill that same person.- Another problem is that the game doesn't let you make decisions quickly, it takes a longer time to play than it should, so that 1-2 hours is definitely drawn out, all whilst the narrator kind of nags at you no matter what you do. - Speaking of that narrator, I know it's been mentioned a fair bit by other reviewers, but I don't think it was done in the best way, it was kind of annoying for a lot of the game. Obviously the point of the narrator is to show you that sometimes no matter what option you choose there will always be someone that disagrees with you or a reason why it wasn't the best choice to make, but this get's extremely repetitive especially in the first part of the game. - I think most of the decisions players make whether considered right or wrong by the majority of people, will have been done for a reason or a thought process however flawed and this game seems to forget that and act's like you didn't consider your answer at all. I think a better approach would have been to question the thinking behind the choices and pose a question that challenges that view rather than just saying something along the lines of \"You made this choice, too bad this could potentially happen or has happened as a result\" when the opposite of that outcome was equally possible. I liked the narrator's performance I just think the writing they were given could have been better. - I think people's annoyance at the narrator's writing also has a lot to do with hypocrisy, where no matter what judgements you make the narrator will make comments about what right do you have to make that judgement or the potential consequences, making asinine comments that often conflict with what the narrator has previously said depending on your choices so the narrator as a character seems inconsistent. Also it's just like I paid money for this experience can you please leave me alone.All in all, I wouldn't mind seeing a similar game to this again it's just that this game doesn't really have enough content, that content is drawn out, the overall message and ideas for the game seem fairly basic, although I believe it's intentional this game doesn't have choices that mean anything if that's something that interests you, the lack of depth in exploring the ideas it touches upon means that the game leaves little impact. The game at times seems to try and guilt trip you, which it then seems to contradict later when it explores the idea that you had limited choices or options to begin with, creating confusion about the berating you've likely just received for the majority of the game. What could have been a thought provoking 60-120 mins is instead quite bland in what it explores."}, {"username": "SirCabbage", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "The start of this game looks and plays really interestingly; but then it tries to force feed you a narrative without your consent or valuing your choices.

Some aspects were better than my original impressions. Others were a little lacklustre. Combat in particular can be satisfying with the right combos of inventory and enough sword cards but less when these do not materialise. A common theme depending on the syngergisation strategy the hero becomes dependent on, given their circumstances.AMBIENCE & AESTHETICS+ MUSICAL SCORE- SUPPORTING AUDIO* VISUALSF:ETF delivers a visual experience of pixelated art, that is quite sharp and grew on me as I spent time with the game. Heroes, monsters, items and locations are all recognisable if basic in appearance. Gamers that aren't fond of pixel graphics wont like what's on offer here. The delicate musical score added an adventuring vibe about and was surprisingly pretty good for a game with this level of budget game.MECHANICS+ CARDS+ STATUSES+ CORRUPTION- NO LEVELLING- COMBAT- UNIQUE ABILITIESThere is a good but small core of game mechanics that allow for a varied dungeon-crawling experience. The mix of card types, inventory items, [&] corrupted items, hero setups and the challenge mode in particular, make for a wide-casted net of possible strategy. All of this tied in with the tactical need to keep the hero alive at it moves from one card to another. Combat takes some getting used to due to being unclear when a card will emit damage to nearby enemies. With no weapon to upgrade over time, this could be a lost opportunity to introduce a little more roleplaying into the game, with equippable items. The use of stealth to avoid confrontations is great but under utilised by a lack of cards. One that seems dependent on the hero being played.Overall mechanics are quite good however with no levelling included the only way of bettering a character is to collect more max. health cards. No option is provided to do the same in parallel for armour. Perhaps even having mana as a pool, rather than a threshold resource that activates powers, would have been a better bet. Allowing these to cast numerous times when in a sticky situation. Essentially having these as stats that can be increased over time like health.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787940273CORE GAMEPLAY+ CHARACTERS* DUNGEON CRAWLING* LEVEL BOSSES + DYNAMIC DUNGEONS+ MINI-LOCATIONS* ADVENTURING* LAYOUTF:ETF very much plays like a solitaire card game but with the guise of an adventuring dungeon-crawler. Its action may be fast paced but there is a decent depth of strategy presented in its challenge. While choosing the route to navigate through a dungeon level may seem like the game's core decision making component, synergising items held in a character's inventory is the key to succeeding.The inclusion of abstracted locations may seem obvious but increase the game's immersion into being one of a dungeon crawler. In particular F:ETF combines its components to deliver an experience may seem simple but sets up an impressive framework to deliver a dynamic challenge not only through the randomisation and deployment of cards but the items that become available throughout a dungeon. ACCESSIBILITY+ TUTORIAL- GUI- SAVE SLOTSWith an intuitive interface F:TEF is a game that is very easy to pick-up and play. After all we will or will have played standard solitaire at some point in our lives. If per chance you have not, then the limited mechanics the game has will be explained in the very short tutorial.COMPLEXITY+ GAME MODES - ROGUE-LIKE RESTARTSWith such a simple design, gameplay is very a straight-forward beast. The two difficulty modes allow players to perfect their strategies and then turn their hand to a more challenging experience. The Challenge mode provides a twist by placing preset restrictions but the Journey mode that allows players to customise the difficulty to their preference. Perfect for casual or hardcore players. The depth to the game really is within the possible synergies.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787940439REPLAYABILITY & LONGEVITY+ CARD DRAWS + UNLOCK HEROES * LEADERBOARDS The core game-loop is designed for fast paced encounters games which are short. Their fixed length also keeps game time narrow. Therefore players will be repeating what is essentially the same core gameplay, over and over. The current modes only slight variation but at least the dynamic nature of the dungeons ensure some differences of experience. Character unlocks only extend gameplay so far.The Challenge mode was a pretty good variant and I would like to see this expanded, so that players are forced to take x good and y corrupted items of their choice. I am disappointed not to see an Infinite mode that would enable players to see how many levels they could take their character through before succumbing to their wounds. Possibly even adding a speed-mode.QUALITY+ ROAD MAP - MINIMAL SETTINGS * POLISHED F:ETF maybe a low budget game by appearance but its elegant design sure does make for some quality entertainment. The soundtrack is another positive  and while pixelated art isn't my greatest joy, it is well-made here. Apart from the lack of Steam integration the negatives to speak of are few and some of those are scheduled to be looked at.VERDICT:F:ETF is a simple, yet solidly well-made game with an addictive quality. Fans of casual and fast-paced games with subtle strategies that rely on synergisation should find something that appeals. Especially fans of solitaire card and dungeon-crawler, which are combined here.Additional content would add variety and an infinite mode would be most welcome. Despite the limited number of possible synergisations, it is WORTHWHILE to play.Thank you for reading. | Follow my curator here. | Key provided by Turn-Based Tactics"}, {"username": "HailIlpala", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "There might be some potential here, but very little challenge and variation in the game play loop as it stands means the fun dies quickly, I don't imagine many people coming back to it after a couple of hours of play.

The truth is these games have been re-released also previously on GOG a few years back. Same exact games. The ones on Steam are no different in terms of the way they look and play. The one major thing the Steam versions have going for them however which would make a good choice for people who are wondering which versions to get are that the Steam ones are more streamlined in overall presentation. The games on GOG come as separate entries in your library. Things such as manuals, guidebooks, codebooks and other content are all downloaded manually on GOG. Some items even have to be extracted after being downloaded as they download in zip files. And then it would be a little cumbersome to search for the necessary documents when you need them each time. What GOG does have going for it though is that they are 100% DRM free titles. Now where Steam shines as mentioned before is how streamlined they are with these games. You get a unified launcher for the gold box games. any games you own in the series will show up in the launcher. so you could launch say Archives Collection One and play Pool of Radiance instead, or maybe Al Qadim, as long as you own those also. Furthermore, documents, code wheels, and everything are accessible right in the launcher. no need to hunt them down. It's recommended to play in a windowed mode to have access to both the game and the launcher for your necessary resources, but the launcher has you covered with a variety of windowed resolutions to make things look nice. GOG on the flipside would require you you to manually go into dosbox to fiddle with these settings as the basic launch only gives you either fullscreen or a tiny window if you alt tab out. It can still work the way you want, but for those not looking to waste time setting things up and get right into the games, the Steam version has got you covered in the best way."}, {"username": "Neferex", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Well here we are, back at it again.

For $ 3.33 per title you cannot go wrong. Play the 3 games in the correct order and you will have a gradually increasing difficulty which makes for smoother sailing. You also get to import your party with their experience levels, equipment and spells from the first all the way to the third, literally watching them grow from novice to master.There are some flaws, like the absence of a proper automap which makes navigating the mazes a bit difficult (the trilogy comes with hint books which includes maps and the external \"All-Seeing-Eye\" automapper, but you will have to play the game in windowed mode because the All-Seeing-Eye is an external program that requires a separate window), or the pretty poor sound effects/music (the games were released 1991 - 1993).Still, the graphics still look pretty darn good today (nice art design), controls are super easy and the monster variety is superb. Also, these \"step-by-step\" scrolling dungeon crawlers look much better than their \"technically advanced\" smooth-scrolling cousins, which tend to get very blocky at close-ups. With BLACK CRYPT being an Amiga-exclusive, and a GOG/Steam release of DUNGEON MASTER 1 & 2 still not in sight, this trilogy are the best dungeon crawlers you can get on Steam/GOG.

In the life-changing milestones of our lives, this was one of the most prominent.WARNING: It's definitely, unabashedly old school. It's clunky, it's unforgiving, and it used all media types to play, from game to paperback journal entries to language-deciphering codewheel.Luckily though, this version comes with a built-in Companion module to simplify the playing experience and provide quality of life improvements like automap feature with ability to label areas, ability to change the font (since a lot of us original players are much older now and our eyes don't work so well), all documentation just a click away.Even some built-in, toggle-able \"cheats\" such as automatically ID'ing magical items, ability to heal damage and status effects while camping, auto ammo replentishing, and spell memorization.The series is absolutely huge, with lots of areas to explore, turn-based strategical combat, good story depth if you follow along with the journal entries, and since you get 8 full games for $10 its price vs content value is exceptional.Still, it's old-school to the max. It's slow-paced and requires a lot of saving, even to the point where you'll probably save before every door, 'cause you just don't know what's on the other side that will totally wreck your party, or accidentally buy something expensive just to find out the character can't use it, and even the death of a party member can quickly drain your resources.If you can endure, you will smile and you will rage, but you will feel that you were the hero of an epic adventure."}, {"username": "rrdy68", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "My original thoughts on this version was wrong.  The companion app on this one does not have everything that the free download app has but you dont have to load the companion app separately every time and you can transfer characters between games.

For those of you having trouble with making characters use the number 1 key for down and the number 7 key for up on the number pad to scroll up and down your choices.  When you modify your characters scroll down the stats and use the left and right arrow keys to increase or decrease the number. You may also increase your new characters starting hit points in the same way. In combat you can use the arrow keys or the number keys to move as is listed in the control section of the rules.

In each game of the Saga, you can transfer your characters from a previous game making it out to be one epic adventure. In addition to the Pools Saga, there are the 2 classics of the Savage Frontier. In Frontier games you will find the first time in the history of PC gaming NPCs that could interact with meaningfully, even the first time you could have a romance. The final game in this volume, Unlimited Adventures, is for those that really enjoy the game engine. It allows you to make your own games. The negative in all this is that the modern gamer will hate this game. I would never have got it myself if it did not come with an auto mapper and the app that made it more playable. The app allows you to access logs, journals, and hints if you need them. Back in the day, most of this took a lot of work and most of the time you did your own mapping. What remains a nightmare for me is the loot management. For instance, after each battle you must decide what to do with the loot, where it goes, who will take it, and all through a series of changing inventory screens. This is simply no fun and takes up a great deal of the game. The combat is also no fun and its pretty dull in terms of the modern turn-based games out there. Thankfully, there is a quick option that allows for an auto battle.

Clerics never learn healing spells or resurrections other than Cure Minor Wounds, while Druids get Cure Serious Wounds, and Cure Critical Wounds, as well as the Raise Dead spell. Clerics are seriously under powered/low-utility.Wake of the Ravager Tips (adding as I play through):- Left shift key skips the opening videos- The default Half-Giant gladiator character (Gerakis) starts with a special weapon, so start with him and transfer the weapon over and drop/add a new character in his place if you want the weapon but not the character.

It makes up for its shortcomings by offering a great story and a new, innovative setting, sort of a fantasy Mad Max / Roman Empire mix. Unusual races such as Mantis-Women (Thri-Kreen), which are usually the bad guys in AD&D games, half-giants and half-dwarves are new playable races - and my first party I played through consisted of 4 mantissisis... you get it.Apart from the usual AD&D classes of the time (fighter, ranger, cleric, mage, thief) DARK SUN adds gladiator (variation of the barbarian), druid and psionicist, the latter coming with an entire spellbook of their own and three (!) disciplines. That's a lot of spells! The spells alone take up over 30 pages of the manual.Combat is tactical and unlike the earlier Gold Box games it does not switch screens for combat - the entire game is played from an isometric point of view.The controls are a bit wonky, especially during combat the distance between the sprites is not always clear, and sometimes friend and foe are indistinguishable (especially when it's Thri-Kreen against Thri-Kreen). This is even worse in the sequel, WAKE OF THE RAVAGER, which came out exactly a year later but manages to look much worse than SHATTERED LANDS did. Also during non-combat the controls aren't that great: there are no icons save one (options menu), so selecting a cursor for each action (walk, use, attack) is done by cycling through these cursor with the right mouse button. Of the old SSI \"Gold Box\" re-releases (although not really part of the \"Gold Box\" series) this set is only second to the EYE OF THE BEHOLDER series.

Nope. It's a brownish-red wall (the exact same tile used as the village of Barovia) with a fancy door. The drawbridge of the cutscene is nowhere to be seen. They even had to put a sign in front of it \"Castle Ravenloft\" so you know what you're looking at! The Old Svalich Road is just a small path surrounded by two walls - also with signs telling you that it's a road and not a dungeon.

There is no river. No body of water anywhere. Either the engine could not create a floor tile that's blue to simulate a river or the developers were too lazy.The graphics engine is so bad that maneuvering is a chore. Turning around takes almost half a minute, while in STRAHD'S POSSESSION the enemies are zippy-fast and often times maneuver around the party. While you try to turn around to face them, they will have hit your party multiple times.STONE PROPHET slightly improved the graphics. VERY SLIGHTLY. It still is an ugly looking game. I guess since it takes place in a desert (brown floor, from walls) it gets away with its limitations more than STRAHD'S POSSESSION does. The Ancient Egyptian -styled theme really isn't horror, but at least it's different and of the two titles STONE PROPHET is (SLIGHTLY) better. Combat has also been improved as enemies no longer move faster than the party (now everybody moves VERY SLOW) and they no longer circle the party.STONE PROPHET retains the cringe-worthy voice acting and weird dialogues (really? NOBODY talks like that!!!).Both games used a higher resolution (mid-res 320x400 instead of the common 320x200 resolution for the time) but managed to look a lot worse than the lower resolution games such as DOOM or SHADOWCASTER.It's a real pity that nobody since has picked up the RAVENLOFT license (save a stupid beat 'em up game IRON & BLOOD) and delivered a real RAVENLOFT experience worthy of the campaign setting. Stay away from these two turds!

Only a few minor frustrations that can easily be fixed.Awesome game. I love the concept and balance seems pretty good for an Early Access game. I loved it so much I had to show my wife. We played though 3 stars in the first sitting. I love the idea of having the extra helpers.So, that's the good stuff, on to how I in my infinite wisdom would improve it. The only real issues I had was with the helpers. First the serving helper. It would be nice to be able to assign them to an area or tables. Maybe take control like you do with the cooks and go up and interact with the tables you want them to serve. I had a \"VIP\" table and my server kept serving it before I could add the special dressing. Also a toggle on if the server would grab a dish with \"special dressing\" on it would be good too but that might be going to far. Accidents should happen :)Second, with the cook recording. I had to stop several times from a misclick. In these cases the \"ghost\" dish was still there and I would have to pick up the fryer and counters before doing it again. I would recommend a button (maybe the same as the summon) that would just reset the recording and remove all the ghost dishes that were placed or interacted with. Roll back your command pattern queue to the start of the recording.Two minor issues that will in no way stop me from playing but does cause some frustration.

I have tested out the co-op option with at least one other person and experienced no gameplay issues, and I look forward to testing with more friends. The music is laid back and chill, and the animations are charming and well done. While there can be some tense moments due to the clock or *ahem* other situations, overall I found the gameplay loop to be surprisingly relaxing. The only negatives I've encountered thus far is that this game is really meant to be played with a controller. The keyboard controls are difficult to get used to and while I found them un-intuitive, I'm honestly not sure that there are better options. I would appreciate the ability to re-bind keyboard controls so players could at least tinker with other options.

I've only played for around 100 minutes as of writing and I am already in love. However it does need some re-balancing. Now to be fair, I wrote this on the day it came out, so obviously there are gonna be some balance issues. I'm just gonna list about things I noticed:Conquest Mode: This is the main mode of the game, where you invade sectors across 4 islands and conquer the enemy base at the end. It has a cool risk and reward system where the more sectors you invade, the more units and abilities you get, however the stronger the enemy becomes. The only thing I have to say about this game mode is that it needs difficulty descriptions for the sectors, as some battles will be harder than others and you can't really tell.Endless Mode: Pretty obvious here, you pick whatever units you want and survive as long as possible against an enemy that's getting more and more difficult as it progresses, I didn't really find many issues with it, but I wasn't really too interested either.Random Battle: This is honestly my favorite mode. you spawn with varied (i would say random but I think some units are always added no matter what for fairness) units and try and defeat the enemy AI. Its nice for trying out new units and is also nice as you don't have full control over your starting units. I think the AI do need to be updated, as each difficulty seems rather easy to beat no matter which you select.Balance issues:your regular standard grunt unit has a grenade launcher that can nearly insta-kill basic enemy units (I should note now this game has no multiplayer and some of the AI's units are different than yours) - To fix this, maybe make it a tier 1 upgrade, as to be fair, they only get 1 shot, they can miss it, and it is useful for enemy defenses and vehicles.you can spawn 3 support units, and I believe their buffs might stack, which is pretty unfair, plus they have an artillery attack and having 3 of them at once using it seems a lil unfair.you can spawn 3 snipers who will sit FAR from the enemy and just pick them off without destroying the enemy base. they do insta-kills on infantry so you could essentially just grind with them, or spawn a single unit and just push with them while the snipers cover, and the snipers get a HUGE range boost when you use the hold button, making them even more unfair - my idea for this is to just make it so you can only spawn one, they can only push a little forward, and are more defensive type unitsthe shield units can be spawned in 3s and are really useful when the enemy has a lot of infantry or snipers, but i think their health should be reduced some.you can spam turrets with enough funds in clustered groups.units don't need to recharge which means as soon as one dies, you can instantly spawn another, which is fine for weaker units, but is really unfair for your tougher units, plus some units have abilities to spawn more units that don't add to your unit limit/supply/whatever its called.other than that and some other issues I probably don't know about, the game is fun and is a good way to waste time, plus it has no micro transactions, which also a plus in my bookIdeas I have:More unitsmore mapsdifferent themed enemies (aesthetics mostly, but having different themed enemies with their own custom units would be cool as well)more unit customization, maybe different base designs or unit outfits, or anything along those lines.Different types of battles. This might need some explanation. I noticed that based on difficulty, the enemy will have a different base designs each time. I think these bases having their own abilities would be cool, for example, there is an enemy base that is basically a big friggen missile on the back of a truck. maybe you need to destroy the truck before time runs out, or maybe a base that has turrets and can defend itself. Stuff like that.TL;DR the game is fun and a good time waster.

Units seem to have clear counters and strengths, upgrade progression feels nice, it feels well balanced all around.One of my favourite things about Warpips so far is, I never feel like I have to think about too much at once. I can enjoy the chaos, without straining my brain to the point that I can no longer focus on anything aesthetic at all {looking at you, Starcraft}. The fact that there is very little micro-management in this game means the player is truly in more of a \"commander\" seat, rather than an all-controlling god. You just say what your army should look like, and when they should move, but they'll figure out the details themselves.

This is a conversion game focused on intersecting boosts. You unlock many, many different types of resources that will all feed into each other in different ways. You also unlock far more spells than you're going to be able to use, and a bunch of spellbooks to create your own clusters for conversion and boosts. This isn't a new idea, especially in incremental games, but this game takes the most rewarding version of this mechanic and makes it active. There's a lot of changes that needed to happen to facilitate this, and the UI is what carries this game.Your view is split into tabs that you unlock over time. Each tab focuses on a specific purpose. The upshot of this is that most tabs use one or two primary types of resources. This lets you build spellbooks for that purpose, and also lets you jump around until you see something you want to focus on. It helps reduce decision paralysis. All resources are depicted by icons, and many of them also by bars that are always visible. There's also some signposting to give you an idea of what direction you should go, and little reminder icons if there's unique progression you can work towards. All of this gives you intermediate goals that you can achieve in very broad ways without ever feeling overwhelmed.So this isn't a puzzle in the way that Realm Grinder is a puzzle, where the next goal is an increasingly difficult maximization effort. It's a puzzle in the sense that new resource and conversion types continuously pop up, and you need to figure out whether and how to use them properly and incorporate them into what you're doing. You can always hit the breakpoints you need to hit given enough time jumping around tabs, and more effective/efficient ways of doing things are unlocked with time. It's a matter of choosing what you feel is the most effective or efficient method to get wherever you want to go. It makes play a lot less stressful. And I find myself just chilling with this game for the same sense of progress that I'd get from an incremental game, but with a much stronger and more immediate reward system.There's some things that are still missing that I feel could help enormously. I desperately want a tab that displays the spells and alchemies that I can level, with the same appearance as the traditional upgrade screens.

I see a lot of people comparing it to Cookie Clicker, but I'm not sure I agree. Rather than having a single resource that you have to slowly work up over hours, you have 19 different resources that you are constantly juggling and using. Cookie Clicker has a LOT of down time and isn't really all that actively engaging. Fun in it's own way, but very different. This game has practically no down time. You will ALWAYS have something to do to progress. Usually 9 different things. And all of them will make you stronger and help you push past to the next milestone in the next areas. It's also the kind of game that unfolds as you play it. I'm not sure puzzle is the right word, but there is a constant sense of discovery as you continue to unlock new ways to interact with the game.I will say, try not to pick it up unless you have some time free, because I have to wake up and go to work in two hours and I haven't slept yet.

It's effectively a rogue-like haunted house with some minor survival elements like hunger, thirst, and sanity. Where the game falls flat is it's really samey enemies and unbearably loud screamers._____SIGHTS & SOUNDS:I do think the game looks quite nice visually with everything fitting the retro \"found-footage\" esq style it seems to be going for; it does of course get very samey considering the source material of using the backrooms, but each floor being slightly different from the last does help reduce the repetition.From an audio standpoint I'm going to be really blunt, it's not very fun or atmospheric to listen to. Almost every single enemy in the game screeches and screams at you when giving chase, which can get headache inducing after just a run or two of playing; have two different enemies chase you at the same time and you may as well just take off your headphones. What's even worse however is that the game, no joke, has PNG screamers in it. At some random points during gameplay you'll be blasted by an insanely loud screamer coupled with a \"scary\" PNG spread across your screen. Not only do these sap all of atmosphere or immersion the game has, but they make the game pretty unpleasant to play. Luckily you can completely mute these in the settings menu, but they shouldn't even be in to begin with in my opinion.Small nitpick, the game tells you when starting a run to listen carefully for sounds, but 95% of the stuff you'll hear are red herrings, which makes actually trying to play around audio basically impossible._____HOW IT PLAYS:I actually love this game's pitch when it comes to gameplay; A replayable rogue-like horror game filled with all types of fun horror tropes and threats trying to kill you as you explore each new floor. It's a great concept that I genuinely think this game comes fairly close to delivering on, but isn't all there just yet. The addition of character classes also adds a small chunk of replayability and immersion too, I really love that aspect and would love to see it expanded with more big upgrades you can find for your character as your run progresses.The main letdown is sadly the enemies. They all might look visually unique from each other but they all act in the exact same way; they see you, they chase you, nothing else. There's so much oppertunity here to have all the enemies do cool, unique things from each other. Stuff like moving through walls, cutting you off, stalking you between rooms, ambushing you as you explore, blind enemies that can only hear you, etc, but there's none of that here. For now they're all effectively just reskins of the same enemy._____THINGS I THINK COULD BE IMPROVED:1. Remove the screamers, they ruin the atmosphere.2. The threats should be more unique to play against.3. I'd like to see more audio that's useful to the player to listen for to avoid threats.4. Don't have every threat scream at you when chasing, it would be far scarier for some to make other noises or even nothing at all.5. Perks or skills that you collect mid-run would be a fun way to make runs more unique.6. More utility items that help you explore or avoid threats would also be fun.7. It would be nice to start with a small light source so you aren't left totally blind in dark floors if you didn't find one on the previous floor. (Something small like a lighter) _____SUMMARY:While I love the idea, I really do think the execution needs to be improved before I could properly recommend the game to people. As it stands it ruins it's own immersion with cheap screamers, is a headache to listen to when being chased, and the enemies you're up against become very dull to play against after a few floors. I really hope this game aims to get some serious improvement under it's belt because I think there's the DNA of a fantastic game in here somewhere. I'm really optimistic and hopeful this game is going to turn out great, but for now it's not there."}, {"username": "QueenCityQ.TTV", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "The backrooms Survive was a neat little RG map game.

Paddywhack", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "For people who haven't played the original Demon Turf:These new stages are a condensed form of the original game's best elements. Its focus as a 3D platformer is smooth movements and momentum; what some may call \"schmooving\" or \"swooncing\". The main character controls with a fusion of A Hat in Time's precise, airborne tricks; and Mario 64/Sunshine's high-skill-ceiling manoeuvrability and flips. But unlike those collection-driven games, the stages themselves are far closer to a linear Sonic Adventure or Crash Bandicoot level: obstacle courses with loads of death-defying jumps over pits, sprinkled with secrets and shortcuts. The only purpose the collectables serve here is to unlock optional harder stages, and extra movement options. The joy comes from finding fun ways to navigate, threading the needle between platforms, and sometimes getting in places you're not supposed to. The game is designed with speedrunners in mind, with quick stage completion times linked to unlockables; while a checkpoint system helps you practice tricky sections and makes it very forgiving when you throw yourself into danger.Every bit of the presentation compliments that feeling of breaking a stage's rules; while it might not be to everyone's taste, everything from the 2.5D gremlin protagonist to the fast-paced music to the graffiti-style paint you leave behind is part of its garage-rock attitude. You could compare the original's rough, demonic aesthetic to something like Jimmy Two-Shoes or Billy and Mandy, filtered through a 90s Doom mod with a dash of Disgaea - Neon Splash covering it all in a thick Splatoon coating.Neon Splash has no spoilers for the original game (the original wasn't plot-heavy anyway, and this one has even less of an excuse for a plot), so it's a good place to sample it without making a huge commitment/investment. One big issue is that it immediately gives you some abilities that you had to unlock in the original, so it may be overwhelming; but the stages are designed to introduce and lead you through each tool in your moveset. The optional stages bring in more obstacle types from the original, which might put you off-guard at first - they're introduced a little more cleanly in the original. That, and many of the controls/abilities are objectively improvements on the original, so it might be hard to go back.For people who've already played the original Demon Turf:The thing that keeps this from being a simple level pack is the movement. Beebz controls a lot more intuitively, between expanded jump options, and gliding/wheel abilities available together. This entirely replaces the combat - the only dangers left are pits and spikes, and the game is funner for it. It's also removed the grappling hook (*sigh*) and the time freeze (*YESSS*). I was surprised at how quickly my muscle memory adapted to the new controls. Cutting down the checkpoints from 3 permanently-placeable ones to a single movable one makes for a surprisingly big change; it encourages you to experiment more with riskier movement and exploration. Both since you can respawn closer, and because you can miss collectables on the first run through a stage if you replace your checkpoints too quickly.Speaking of collectables, the number of things to grab is drastically cut down, with the Remix Levels not even having any; the remaining collectibles are better-hidden. There's none of the sidequests/hubs/story from the original, either - in fact, the only returning NPCs are Luci and Midgi. Considering that Luci was heavily promoted in the original relative to her limited screentime and story role, this feels like it's finally giving her the focus she needed. Midgi, meanwhile, takes over the badge section, which has been merged with the cosmetics; the badges are totally new and change movement in bigger ways than the original, but there are fewer of them and you have less ways to combine them.The graphics and sound all have more of an \"Ａ ｅ ｓ ｔ ｈ ｅ ｔ ｉ ｃ\" feel. The original game's dusty reds and purples have been repainted in glowing teal and lime-green (though you'll recognise some reused assets). The raps and shanties are replaced with high-octane techno. With no enemies or bosses to banter with, even the dialogue is more laid-back, a vacation from the turf wars. Some people will prefer this, but I personally miss the original game's E10+ Edge. (It's jarring reaching level clear screens without \"Beebz the Slaya\" playing!)The \"target time\" for each level is between 2-3 minutes, and there's less repetition of obstacles compared to the original. This is nowhere near a full sequel, and you'll likely see everything the game has to offer in a fraction of the original campaign's completion time. (I got all the achievements in around 5.5 hours, and I'm a slow player who takes every scenic route.)

Goblet matched me perfectly, idk how you guys do it but the games have been accurate every time and they always make me rethink how I have been living my life, even if I don't usually have the energy or drive to make the changes it suggests, I at least know what needs changed when I do get to a point where I can make that change.I did originally find these games through markiplier, and I think its amazing that you put that bit at the end there thanking him.I can't wait to see your next game, you have yourself a life long fan in me."}, {"username": "Thornfire", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Every one of these game that I have played has been an enlightening experience.

The game has great art, atmospheric music, and great story and writing just like the other games but I love the RPG maker style of the game - that is what makes this one of my favorite games from Randumb Studios.  The developer is so nice and even if the story is dark - it always ends on a happy note which is better than some horror games that are fun to play but end horribly.  I recommend this game at full price - it's a really fun game - asks more challenging questions than the other ones in my opinion.  I look forward to playing the rest of your games, Randumb Studios! Thanks for making these - they always make me feel better in these difficult times."}, {"username": "kenziewaltz", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "SHEPERD. <3 Guys, I absolutely LOVED your game. It was so beautifully written, the art style was incredible, and the music...the MUSIC is why I fell in love with this game. It is an absolute masterpiece of a game for the price it is on Steam, and I'm now going to add this into my top favorite games of all time. I loved the introspectiveness of it all, and even answering the questions was a challenge, because they were uncomfortable to face and be honest with myself...but it's such a great experience, dare I say even an awareness tool to understand yourself better. I really loved everything about this game. Well done. One note: maybe next time make your scrolling stories a little bit easier to read by allowing the players to control that themselves. I was trying to read it slowly and ended up speeding to get through the sentences. lmao But otherwise this was such a great game and I'd recommend it to everyone. Cool little easter egg with those graveyards in the beginning, too. :)I cannot wait to see what future titles you have in store and I'll most certainly be looking for more of your games to play."}, {"username": "bigbloon", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Secret word: FortressI saw this game, bought it while knowing next to nothing, and was absolutely blown away by the end of it.

The kind of thing I would have found in the bargain bin at Funcoland, or with a big yellow DISCOUNT sticker under the counter at Games & Recovery. And I would have bought it for $8, and played it while everyone else was playing the new Kirby or whatever, and had no one to talk to about it.It would have been my own personal, strange experience that I would have obsessed over and draw pictures of that no one else understood. And like all the others, it would have vanished into memory a few years later, influencing me in ways I can't even begin to guess at.That's what this title feels like. Playing it now, it seems familiar, and close, like something I should have experienced years ago.I think part of that is how good and how true the horror story is. It lives at the crossroads of fairytale and campfire story. It fits with the other spooky stories I heard as a kid. The scope is right for the type of game that it is.It might not be a suppressed memory from childhood, but it earns a similar space on the dusty back-shelves of my mind.Absolutely worth a few dollars.—Benji"}, {"username": "Birthday!", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Excellent vacation!10/10The lake was full of all SORTS of fish!Nothing creepy going on here.
