Yes, only if you really love social deduction/board games. It's going to appeal to a very niche audience and let's be completely real here. Yes, this game is good but it's very limited in terms of scope and reach. You'll have some good first impressions but after the first couple of games you've basically seen it all. It's decent with randoms but very fun with friends. Good but be wary of the RNG and learning curve. If you can get past that then by all means give it a go. Just feels like the same kinda shot itself in the foot and should've been free to play with some costumes/skins to buy instead of 20$ on only Steam.

Which of the NPCs is the murderer? Who is their victim? Deducing or attempting to keep this truth concealed forms the foundation of this multiplayer deduction game. Sherlock players attempt to find clues and strategically position NPCs so no potential victim is left alone with a potential murderer and weapon. Meanwhile, Moriarty players attempt to bring murderer and weapon into place.The game seems remarkably griefing-proof. The murderer is identified by the Sherlock AI through a process of elemination. For example, any NPC that Moriarty controls can't be the victim (but are POSSIBLY the murderer, unless eliminated by other evidence), and are crossed off. And every 3 turns, Sherlock determines whether the victim is within 3 squares of the murderer, which eliminates more possibilities. This seems like a superior design to games like Among Us, where people just throw cack at a wall to see what sticks."}]}, {"game_id": "1475810", "game_title": "Ghostwire_Tokyo", "overall_score": "- 80% of the 3,407 user reviews for this game are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Singleplayer", "Supernatural", "First-Person", "Action-Adventure", "Action", "Open World", "Horror", "Atmospheric", "Lore-Rich", "Surreal", "Story Rich", "Mystery", "Combat", "Exploration", "Adventure", "FPS", "Cyberpunk", "Realistic", "Psychological Horror", "Hentai"], "reviews": [{"username": "SpazmanianDevil", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "This game is one giant collectathon which suits me just fine.

There's also nothing for the melee department. There isn't anything like summoning a fire sword that you can use against enemies. This is creatively bankrupt and it shocks me that the man who made this studio was Shinji Mikami. It is embarrassing that his name is now put into this game.The combat also doesn't improve with the poor array of enemy types. The enemies have cool designs even tho most of them look identical. The way their attacks are choreographed are all quite different. The flaw here is that 95% of enemies require the same way to kill which is by spamming everything you have at it. Only one enemy that actually forced me to change elements and that is the fat shield guys because you gotta use the water elements since it's like shotgun. This just makes combat way more bland than it already is. This world is the definition of empty. The map screen is so cluttered with icons: there are telephone booths everywhere in this game, why did the developers have the need to place all of them on the map screen? Same goes for the flying demons. They felt like they need to show everything on the map, no matter how badly it effects the experience as a whole.The worst aspects of this open world is definitely collecting spirits. There are a total of 240000 spirits you need to collect (probably 35-40 hours of all game). How do you collect spirits you may ask? Well, you hold the right mouse button. You do this for every single spirit you find. And then there's the side quest which I gave them a chance. In this game, you talk to random souls that all have the exact same design. There is absolutely no way for anyone to be interested in whatever is happening to these people.95% of buildings in this game you can not enter and when there are, it is stopped by a loading screen and you're teleported into the building. What year is this? Am I back in 2012? Even Yakuza Kiwami fixed this problem long ago. What a joke.Story: the most generic anime plot to ever exist. Blank protagonist who cares for his blank of a sister who is working with a blank detective to save Tokyo from a blank villain. That's the best way I can put this story.

Decide to fork over $20 to try it out3. Have a blast for 2-3 hours while you slowly start to understand the nuances of the mechanics4. Eventually get matched into a game with people who have been playing the game nonstop since beta5. Realize that apart from a few key abilities and weapons that are easily exploitable, most of the hunter upgrades you spent hours unlocking are pretty useless compared to the harpoon gun + ecto sensor6. Realize that hiding as a ghost is less effective than simply finding the smallest object in a level and spending the whole game darting around, dodging the hunter's attacks until midnightThe game advertises itself as a fun \"hide and seek\" game. This is false. MGH game is basically Call of Duty dressed up to look like a fun prop hunt game to play casually.Unfortunately, I don't see these as issues that can be fixed through anything short of a total overhaul of the mechanics. The developer's claim that the \"win rates hover around 50 / 50\" simply reinforces my opinion that any nerfs made to gameplay elements like hunter ammo, harpoon limitations, etc. will actually throw the game balance out of whack unless nerfs are made to the ghosts as well.Overwatch had a similar issue when the pro scene discovered GOATS comp, which ultimately led to the enforcement of team comp in QP and Ranked play. Bottom line: there's just no good solution to mechanics that are this fundamentally opposed to what the game is advertised as.Before I wrap up, I do want to recognize that the developers seem to be very responsive, passionate, and invested in working with their community to make this game great.

You just get taken advantage of in game until you save enough currency to do the exact same to new players trying it out for the first time. Maybe for some that could be fun but I don't see the enjoyment in both getting absolutely demolished or dealing the same fate to players with less play time once you've reached that stage. The combat could use a little more feedback in the form of animations or audio queues.I like the idea of the game but the mechanics don't seem to fit the concept too well at this point in time and then of course all the little nitpicking that goes along with playing any game.

The way their attacks are choreographed are all quite different. The flaw here is that 95% of enemies require the same way to kill which is by spamming everything you have at it. Only one enemy that actually forced me to change elements and that is the fat shield guys because you gotta use the water elements since it's like shotgun. This just makes combat way more bland than it already is. This world is the definition of empty. The map screen is so cluttered with icons: there are telephone booths everywhere in this game, why did the developers have the need to place all of them on the map screen? Same goes for the flying demons. They felt like they need to show everything on the map, no matter how badly it effects the experience as a whole.The worst aspects of this open world is definitely collecting spirits. There are a total of 240000 spirits you need to collect (probably 35-40 hours of all game). How do you collect spirits you may ask? Well, you hold the right mouse button. You do this for every single spirit you find. And then there's the side quest which I gave them a chance. In this game, you talk to random souls that all have the exact same design. There is absolutely no way for anyone to be interested in whatever is happening to these people.95% of buildings in this game you can not enter and when there are, it is stopped by a loading screen and you're teleported into the building. What year is this? Am I back in 2012? Even Yakuza Kiwami fixed this problem long ago. What a joke.Story: the most generic anime plot to ever exist. Blank protagonist who cares for his blank of a sister who is working with a blank detective to save Tokyo from a blank villain. That's the best way I can put this story. The acting is also weak, the amount of overacting in this one is hilarious and no scene will even touch your emotions.Ghostwire: Tokyo the only way to describe the game comes in mind = colossal disappointment!"}, {"username": "Astracus", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I finished this game yesterday, and I really did enjoy it.I 100%'d it in about 36 hours, completing the achievements wasn't too hard, except for the RNG one, I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hated it.The graphics were really awesome, and it seemed well optimized, until I got FPS drops randomly, where it'd go from 20 to 70 FPS, while I used to get a stable 130/144FPS while not bugged, but it'd eventually get fixed by itself after a few seconds, except for a couple of times where I had to restart.I really did like the story, you don't have choices to change the ending like in other games, but still very enjoyable to me, even if kinda short, didn't exactly feel rushed, while I played all the side quests while doing it, but I guess somebody who played the main story only would feel like it is.I read a lot of people who complained about the combat system, calling it repetitive and stuff, but I didn't find it boring, it was fun to me.So overall, I'd really recommend this game, and if you're scared about the \"horror\" part of it, I didn't find it particularly creepy, there was only one single jumpscare in the whole game too, so shouldn't be that big of a deal."}, {"username": "KawaiiAngel-chan", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "The amazing visuals and great enemy designs kind of carry this game's lacking gameplay and writing.

AI employees will generally be able to handle tasks by themselves aside from a 3-4 that need to be unlocked via levelling the staff. This adds some frustration as you're often \"hands-off\" and it becomes boring to wait for something to do, only to look away for a couple minutes and realise something broke down and you were the only one who could fix it, holding up the AIs. Furthermore, it appears that you are not able to hire anyone who inherently has different skills (e.g., someone good at cooking, another good at cleaning or taking care of cats) which means you're forced to wait to perform these duties yourself. Really needs a x2 or x3 speed button.Resources -I found that this game was significantly more grind-y than expected. Difficulty in collecting resources you need spikes rapidly, meaning that you sometimes need to sit through multiple days to afford enough ingredients to make a new menu item. This process can be sped up by sending cats out for adoption; however this mechanic is disappointing as the game simply posts requests on an \"adoption board\" where the same individuals are asking for cats with one specific attribute. There is no interaction or sense of \"fulfilling a request\" and is basically just exchanging cats for resources. Cats - Very cute aesthetic and designs for NPCs, cats, and decorations. Management-wise there seem to be no repercussions for having inadequate amenities for your cats. Some have increased food, play, or sanitation requirements but these never had a noticeable impact on how the cats acted or the utilities you required in the building.Bugs:1. Unsure if this was intended, but even though you have the ability to \"set your menu\" for the day, customers would start ordering items that hadn't even been unlocked yet and would need to be served a substitute. (I just don't really understand why someone would come to a cafe and order something they don't serve??)2.

Must buy for adventure fans."}, {"username": "Max", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "(originally published on Gamepur.com)One of the first games I ever owned was The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, on the original Game Boy. It looks laughably dated now — it did come out in 1993, to be fair — but it’s got a special spot in my heart to this day. I still get that rush of nostalgic exhilaration when I think about the exploration and mystery baked into that game, and the hours I poured into my Game Boy Pocket over the Christmas of 1996.Tunic, from developer Andrew Shouldice and publishers Finji, wears its influences plainly on its sleeve. It’s easy to see the inspiration it’s taken from the Zelda series, particularly Link’s Awakening. The main character, an adorable little fox, wears a green tunic and wields a sword in one hand, a blue-and-red-patterned shield in the other. You even start off by waking up on a beach and must piece together the mystery of the island on which you’re stranded as you progress through the game. The art style, too, is reminiscent of Nintendo’s remake of Link’s Awakening from a few years ago, with its simple but lovingly-crafted visuals.This is no mere copy of a more established game series, though. Tunic has an astonishing amount of depth to it, and the elements it borrows from other games, whether aesthetic, narrative, or mechanical, all serve the game’s own unique identity.At first glance, Tunic is a fairly straightforward adventure game. You wake up on a beach, find a weapon, bash some monsters, and just have a good old explore. There’s a lot of Zelda DNA in there, but there’s also a significant amount of Dark Souls as well. Perhaps it’s considered gauche to compare things to Dark Souls these days, but the parallels are undeniable. From the dramatic and tough-as-nails bosses, to the shrines scattered about the map that serve as checkpoints, and even to the initial objective of ringing two massive bells, it’s clear that FromSoft was not far from the developer’s mind.Combat will be familiar to anyone who’s played an isometric Soulslike. Enemies telegraph their attacks with just enough of a window to let you react accordingly once you learn the tells. You have to manage your health, stamina, and, later on, magic bars accordingly. You can roll, at the cost of a bit of stamina, and the invincibility frames granted during that animation will be key to surviving encounters. The bosses are absolutely brutal, but with patience and a little bit of luck you’ll be able to feel that intoxicating sense of satisfaction in taking them down. There are a couple of little quality-of-life and accessibility options available too — if your twitch reflexes aren’t what they used to be, you can turn on invincibility or infinite stamina and just enjoy the story or hunt for secrets.That brings me to the other major way that this unassuming little adventure cribs from Dark Soul: its approach to story and secrets. Where other games may hold your hand and guide you gently through your quest, Tunic leaves clues for you to piece together, crumb by crumb. Most often this takes the form, in a delightfully meta twist, of pages of a retro instruction manual for the game itself. With gorgeous hand-drawn art — also evocative of the promotional material for early Zelda games and the like — and intriguing things scribbled in the margins for the eagle-eyed, these collectibles are a joy to behold. Scattered all across the game, they will introduce players to basic concepts and bits of lore as well as providing a jumping-off point for the myriad secrets waiting to be discovered.The obtuse way that Tunic handles even basic game concepts may well be a sticking point for some players. I enjoyed figuring it all out immensely, but when information like how to level up stats and what certain consumable items do is hidden away inside collectible manual pages, there’s certainly a risk of alienating some players. It should be added, too, that the manual features only a bare smattering of English (or your chosen language) across pages upon pages of an invented and impenetrable language — potentially a point of confusion or frustration for some.Still, the important stuff is fairly easy to parse, and the charming illustrations and pleasingly soothing music help to take the edge off if you’re starting to feel confused. The publishers have also made it clear that they endorse and encourage a bit of good old-fashioned community discussion when it comes to deciphering the game’s lore and secrets. In the press Discord server the team set up for the purpose of sharing strategies and the like, it almost felt like we were back in the schoolyard, swapping urban legends, outlandish theories, and secret codes. Except this time they actually yielded results, which was a wondrous feeling.In the end, despite the debt that it owes to series like The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls, the game that kept springing to mind as I worked my way through Tunic’s late and post-game was Lucas Pope’s Return of the Obra Dinn. Tunic obviously features a lot more action and hack-and-slashing than Obra Dinn, but the sheer depth of the puzzles and secrets tickles that same bit of the brain. Everything you need to know is right there in front of you, hiding in the folds of the environment and the manual’s marginalia — you just need to figure out how to piece it together. As enjoyable as the combat and the main story were, it was the puzzles that I couldn’t stop thinking about, and the feeling of solving each one was practically euphoric.Tunic’s cutesy aesthetic and tips of the hat to other games serve almost as a jumping-off point, a familiar-feeling touchstone to draw players in. Beyond that, the experience is entirely its own, with satisfying and challenging combat, secrets that gradually unfurl, and a quiet and contemplative story with its own twists and revelations. It’s a beautiful and polished little game that asks a lot of its players at times, but it has every confidence that they will rise to the occasion. As the game’s creators put it: “Keep your wits about you and be brave, little fox!”"}, {"username": "Gavitro", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "This game is an experience that is several layers deep, but sadly I spoiled some of those layers for myself because it was a little too difficult for me.

Yes? Then chances are good that you will love this game.Because really, Tunic is two games: a souls-like, and THEN a puzzle game. In that order. Sequentially. As in, once you beat the souls-like, then you play a puzzle game.See, there are two endings. To get the first, you play a souls-like: fight and explore through a series of challenging dungeons and bosses culminating in a tough final boss. I loved this first game! In particular, it's absolutely jam-packed with hidden shortcuts and treasures. The surprises-per-hour rate on this first game is very high, and I was constantly delighted.And after 11 hours of joy, I beat the final boss, and got the bad ending. Enter the second game: a series of puzzles you solve to get the good ending. Is it a BAD series of puzzles? No. But it's not really what I signed up for! The skills I built over the prior 11 hours were made completely irrelevant by this puzzle game. The puzzle game took me about 5 hours, after looking up two specific things. I am dumb, so had I tried it blind, I absolutely never would have gotten the good ending. The choice to lock the good ending behind a second, totally different game is an interesting one.

At the most surface level, its a sort of fusion of the best of the 2D Zelda games with a 'Souls-Like' combat system/philosophy.  That is you go around and explore, find new weapons and tools, unlock new areas with them, and then fight things with brutal and extremely punishing battle mechanics demanding split-second timing of dodge rolls and blocks.Of course, that is only the surface, if you dig down a little deeper you start to find the kind of ridiculously unraveling puzzles that games like The Witness are known for.  Suddenly you start looking at things you have been seeing all along your adventure but with new eyes which recognize hidden meanings, secrets, and all new ways to progress in the game in mechanics you didn't even know existed just before the discoveries.  Then you find even more secrets, even more new systems and methods of play and things really begin to unravel and rebuild in your mind in entirely new ways.And with all of that said, I have focused so much on the mechanics that I haven't even begun to describe the aesthetics.  The visuals are absolutely nothing short of one of the most stunning uses of stylized minimalist 3D that I have ever seen.  At times its so heavily stylized that you begin to lose track of it being 3D at all and it begins to look more like a carefully hand-crafted 2D world of the type that was seen in the heyday of early iPad type of games where things almost look painted and placed, only for your sense of the 3D world to come racing back when you dart around a corner and the camera/perspective does a relatively rare shift.The audio is similarly stunning and the ambient smooth music reminds me of the best of games like Fez where each area has its own theme and the music itself becomes part of the presence of each zone as you wander through it.  From melancholy soft melodies in abandoned ruins of cathedrals to relatively zen synth and almost chip tuney notes as you make your way through forests and gardens.Tying everything together is the in-game manual which has the perfect look and feel of the absolute best manuals of the 8 and 16 bit eras, subtly showing you mechanics and information in a mysterious language you can't hope to comprehend but with bright bubbly visuals and the pencil/pen notes of some unknown previous player to help guide you along.  You only gradually find and assemble the pages for this treasure and each one is a revelation that can open up entire new game mechanics you always had access to but simply did not know about.  The single most enjoyable treasure among so many in this game that you get to experience is the glimmer of yet one more new manual page on the screen which you can then greedily jump into and pore over, zooming in and out to unearth all the information, secrets, guidance, etc that it can have for you.Oh and the entire game is absolutely riddled with foxes among which your character is absolutely the cutest most inspirational and wonderful example and you cannot help but fall in love with their plucky little can-do attitude wonderfully emoted through every little movement and animation as they dart around and run through grass, fields, cliffs, water, etc.  No matter how brutally hard the game gets you can't help but dive back in to help this little fox get just a little further in their quest to... something something!In short yeah this game is honestly right up there in the hierarchy of some of the best indie games that have ever been created, among the company of Fez, The witness, Braid, etc.  Its an absolute treasure and whatever your personal gaming proclivities, you are doing yourself a dis-service if this does not make its way in to your library (and your head-space)."}, {"username": "Suule", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "********Don't believe the specs - it runs on Win 7********If you're looking for that classic Top-Down Zelda experience you might find it here.

Capturing an aesthetic that is just enough of an homage to be present while clearly forging its own identity, Tunic is a joy to play. Its art direction is charming, unique, and consistent throughout though the variety of setting is rich. I found hours melting away as I explored and played. I wanted to see what the game had next, what there was to discover, what secrets the next milestone would reveal, what new and exciting sights there were to behold. I was never disappointed.Half of the impetus to continue exploring was the absolutely stellar soundtrack by Lifeformed and Janice Kwan. I bought the album a mere few hours into the game. The pair have put on a clinic in an OST that's warm, haunting, foreboding, catchy, and sublime throughout. Not to be left out, Power Up Audio has also done an absolutely outstanding job giving the game and its interactables and combat punchy, rich, and powerful sound which remains consistently good throughout.I cannot touch on the story without being vague to avoid spoilers simply because of how rich it is and how important discovery is to the flow of the game. Prepare to be amazed, then amazed again, and again. Chasing the dragon of discovery will be rewarded, guaranteed. The gameplay loop is challenging, but walks the razor's edge of being punishing and rewarding as you become more practiced and confident. It's not souls-hard, but damn near, and the rewards for your endurance are abound. It does not disrespect your time or pound you to dust.All in all, the game is a STEAL at $30. Buy it.

Jet-packing between my multiple miners to grab resources (which frustratingly produce multiple other junk resources making this a longer process), to produce things while there is no threat to me/no survival aspect. Satisfactory overcame this by making logistic systems, whereas in this game the next bit will just involve myself moving back and forth a few dozen times. So I'm staring into the last 5 hours of this game finding little enjoyment at this last leg of the journey. What worries me too is that the developers are planning on extending this portion of the game (making amphibians, insects, etc.) but there is no puzzle, no chance of failure, just plug in hours and get said answer.The initial thrill of the game came from the challenging survival, short lengths of time you can survive outside, prioritising the way through the puzzle with the interesting story.

Sherlock players attempt to find clues and strategically position NPCs so no potential victim is left alone with a potential murderer and weapon. Meanwhile, Moriarty players attempt to bring murderer and weapon into place.The game seems remarkably griefing-proof. The murderer is identified by the Sherlock AI through a process of elemination. For example, any NPC that Moriarty controls can't be the victim (but are POSSIBLY the murderer, unless eliminated by other evidence), and are crossed off. And every 3 turns, Sherlock determines whether the victim is within 3 squares of the murderer, which eliminates more possibilities.

It came out all the way back in 1992 and is generally considered to be one of the biggest dating sims of the time and part of the reason why that genre took off. Now here we are thirty years later with a remaster of that very game. Does it hold up? Kinda.Note: Trimmed review to fit character limit, check video for full version!Story and GameplayThere is practically no real “story” here. You’re just some dude spending the rest of his summer break messing around and trying to pick up some girls. No major drama, no twists, none of that - just constant dates with girls and maybe a little bit of character building for each, especially towards the end.I found this approach to be both good and bad. It’s good in that this lends to a lot of interactivity. You don’t just sit there and spam enter a bunch, but instead are constantly moving around, interacting with the environment and different CGs, and picking which characters you want to talk to by the in-game minute. As someone that plays a ton of visual novels, it was refreshing to have this sense of control.That said - it does come with one major downside: a lackluster main story. If you’re not a fan of whatever character’s story? Well, there’s really nothing else to do other than pursue some other character. They are hardly tied together and even the individual characters themselves don’t have that going for them. Some characters only have a few events and, as such, have really poorly developed personalities, backstories, all that. This leads to the relationship coming off as forced, cheap, and there just to fill a specific archetype.Then you get a few other characters that have a lot of events and even some conflicts to overcome - which in turn develops their character. I found these to be the most satisfying personally. Maybe I just like a well-written character or maybe I’m playing the game wrong by looking for something like that. But again, it is a dating sim, so I would hope that such a game could at least deliver a bit on that front.Even then though, the character stories themselves are the most surface level thing - those conflicts that come up are resolved just as quickly and often left me disappointed with what could have been. Again, some are better than others, but I have now finished the game multiple times and really only liked maybe two or three characters max out of the fourteen total.So I guess it all comes down to what you want. For a dating sim? It’s got pretty much all the bases covered. Don’t go in looking for deeper character writing and you are set. There are a ton of choices to make, tons of places to visit, tons of character events to unlock - the game does an absolutely solid job there. Actually caring for said characters and remembering them weeks after beating the game? Maybe not so much.WritingThe writing is VERY comedy-heavy and VERY 90s. Stupid one-liners, characters acting completely ridiculous, and an overemphasis on perverted jokes. The protagonist definitely fits that last one and pretty much every character has some sort of tripping, falling, or being above the protagonist CG and he happily partakes in the view. I can’t say I’m the biggest fan of that part of the comedy, but the rest at least makes up for it a bit.Difficulty and Route StructureBack in the day, you would have wanted a walkthrough for this one. You need to know which characters to meet at which locations at which times to actually advance along their route and score hearts with them. In classic mode, this information is entirely up to you to figure out, but fortunately, with this remake, comes the now default “easy mode”.This mode just straight up gives you a calendar plotting all of the key dating events and it is super helpful to have as someone that did not want to waste time mapping out this web of character interactions. That and it even tells you what choices earn or lose you hearts - again negating the need for a walkthrough which I usually end up using for most visual novels anyways. A nice addition that makes the game far more playable than it was thirty years ago.LengthI was not able to get all of the characters in my first playthrough, but for those I did (maybe half of them), it took me around eight or so hours. Future playthroughs were even easier because I could just ignore the characters I already completed and just skip directly to the character events I missed. So it’s not that long a VN, but also not too short.Art and MusicAlthough a part of me wishes they had some sort of toggle to enable the old art - I also cannot deny that the new art is completely fine and somehow manages to maintain a newish look while also being somewhat nostalgic. The music, on the other hand, I honestly cannot recall at all now that I’m writing this review. I don’t remember it being terrible though - so let’s just leave it as “okay, but forgettable”.OverallDōkyūsei: Bangin' Summer is a bit of a mixed bag by modern standards. What it lacks in quality writing it makes up for with its solid dating sim mechanics and nostalgic art. That said, I can’t say any of the characters are that memorable and the experience is more so just fun in the moment - the dated humor actually adds to this too. So I wouldn’t say it’s an instabuy, but maybe worth a look if you want to play through a piece of VN and dating sim history. Otherwise, it’s just okay.Follow my Steam Curator Page for more reviews + videos!"}, {"username": "Ranger", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "THE grandaddy to dating sim genre, predating even Tokimeki Memorial. Do note that gameplay mechanic-wise, it's less of 'dating simulator' and more of 'stalking simulator.' And scenario-wise, the script is taken from the 1999 windows port of the game, which is NOT the original 1992 PC98 game. Still, I'm recommending this over the older versions of the game because the quality of life updates like increased save slots, necessary event flag to trigger to get a girl ending are marked so it's easier to get all the girl's scenes, map shows exactly the girl's whereabout instead of having to waste hours to search them, etc.I'm also buying this so one day the devs can remake Kakyuusei 2 in all its glory.

This game is supposedly the forerunner of the modern type dating sim games that we have today and I can see why. unfortunately most of the dating sim games/ visual novel games that I have played so far a lot of them don't compare to this which is really unfortunate since this came out a long time ago. compared to the other dating sim games/ visual novel games that I have played this one has better characters a better story and better game play mechanics then the games that I have played so far. I can say also confidently this game is also worth paying the full price for, some of the visual novels that I have played aren't worth their full price and I wish that I had waited and payed for them when they were on sale.The English translation of this game is also fantastic some of the dating sim/ visual novel games that I have played have had terrible English translation and I can safely say that this translation is one of the best that I have played.  The music to this game is also great and this game has a ton of replay ability to it. there is a ton of different random events scattered throughout the town and a lot of areas that you can actually explore and click on to get additional dialogue /funny dialogue. The Japanese voice acting for the characters is also great.

But again, it is a dating sim, so I would hope that such a game could at least deliver a bit on that front.Even then though, the character stories themselves are the most surface level thing - those conflicts that come up are resolved just as quickly and often left me disappointed with what could have been. Again, some are better than others, but I have now finished the game multiple times and really only liked maybe two or three characters max out of the fourteen total.So I guess it all comes down to what you want. For a dating sim? It’s got pretty much all the bases covered. Don’t go in looking for deeper character writing and you are set. There are a ton of choices to make, tons of places to visit, tons of character events to unlock - the game does an absolutely solid job there. Actually caring for said characters and remembering them weeks after beating the game? Maybe not so much.WritingThe writing is VERY comedy-heavy and VERY 90s. Stupid one-liners, characters acting completely ridiculous, and an overemphasis on perverted jokes. The protagonist definitely fits that last one and pretty much every character has some sort of tripping, falling, or being above the protagonist CG and he happily partakes in the view. I can’t say I’m the biggest fan of that part of the comedy, but the rest at least makes up for it a bit.Difficulty and Route StructureBack in the day, you would have wanted a walkthrough for this one. You need to know which characters to meet at which locations at which times to actually advance along their route and score hearts with them. In classic mode, this information is entirely up to you to figure out, but fortunately, with this remake, comes the now default “easy mode”.This mode just straight up gives you a calendar plotting all of the key dating events and it is super helpful to have as someone that did not want to waste time mapping out this web of character interactions. That and it even tells you what choices earn or lose you hearts - again negating the need for a walkthrough which I usually end up using for most visual novels anyways. A nice addition that makes the game far more playable than it was thirty years ago.LengthI was not able to get all of the characters in my first playthrough, but for those I did (maybe half of them), it took me around eight or so hours. Future playthroughs were even easier because I could just ignore the characters I already completed and just skip directly to the character events I missed. So it’s not that long a VN, but also not too short.Art and MusicAlthough a part of me wishes they had some sort of toggle to enable the old art - I also cannot deny that the new art is completely fine and somehow manages to maintain a newish look while also being somewhat nostalgic. The music, on the other hand, I honestly cannot recall at all now that I’m writing this review. I don’t remember it being terrible though - so let’s just leave it as “okay, but forgettable”.OverallDōkyūsei: Bangin' Summer is a bit of a mixed bag by modern standards. What it lacks in quality writing it makes up for with its solid dating sim mechanics and nostalgic art. That said, I can’t say any of the characters are that memorable and the experience is more so just fun in the moment - the dated humor actually adds to this too. So I wouldn’t say it’s an instabuy, but maybe worth a look if you want to play through a piece of VN and dating sim history. Otherwise, it’s just okay.Follow my Steam Curator Page for more reviews + videos!"}, {"username": "Ranger", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "THE grandaddy to dating sim genre, predating even Tokimeki Memorial. Do note that gameplay mechanic-wise, it's less of 'dating simulator' and more of 'stalking simulator.' And scenario-wise, the script is taken from the 1999 windows port of the game, which is NOT the original 1992 PC98 game. Still, I'm recommending this over the older versions of the game because the quality of life updates like increased save slots, necessary event flag to trigger to get a girl ending are marked so it's easier to get all the girl's scenes, map shows exactly the girl's whereabout instead of having to waste hours to search them, etc.I'm also buying this so one day the devs can remake Kakyuusei 2 in all its glory.

I am glad that they have created a remaster version of this classic dating sim game otherwise I wouldn't have had the pleasure of playing this game because of how old the original game is. This game is supposedly the forerunner of the modern type dating sim games that we have today and I can see why. unfortunately most of the dating sim games/ visual novel games that I have played so far a lot of them don't compare to this which is really unfortunate since this came out a long time ago. compared to the other dating sim games/ visual novel games that I have played this one has better characters a better story and better game play mechanics then the games that I have played so far. I can say also confidently this game is also worth paying the full price for, some of the visual novels that I have played aren't worth their full price and I wish that I had waited and payed for them when they were on sale.The English translation of this game is also fantastic some of the dating sim/ visual novel games that I have played have had terrible English translation and I can safely say that this translation is one of the best that I have played.  The music to this game is also great and this game has a ton of replay ability to it. there is a ton of different random events scattered throughout the town and a lot of areas that you can actually explore and click on to get additional dialogue /funny dialogue. The Japanese voice acting for the characters is also great. I can see the love and effort that was put into this game which is fantastic.Hopefully this game remaster does well and they are able to release a Dōkyūsei 2 remaster in English because I feel like we need more visual novel/ dating sim games like this.

AI employees will generally be able to handle tasks by themselves aside from a 3-4 that need to be unlocked via levelling the staff. This adds some frustration as you're often \"hands-off\" and it becomes boring to wait for something to do, only to look away for a couple minutes and realise something broke down and you were the only one who could fix it, holding up the AIs. Furthermore, it appears that you are not able to hire anyone who inherently has different skills (e.g., someone good at cooking, another good at cleaning or taking care of cats) which means you're forced to wait to perform these duties yourself. Really needs a x2 or x3 speed button.Resources -I found that this game was significantly more grind-y than expected. Difficulty in collecting resources you need spikes rapidly, meaning that you sometimes need to sit through multiple days to afford enough ingredients to make a new menu item. This process can be sped up by sending cats out for adoption; however this mechanic is disappointing as the game simply posts requests on an \"adoption board\" where the same individuals are asking for cats with one specific attribute. There is no interaction or sense of \"fulfilling a request\" and is basically just exchanging cats for resources. Cats - Very cute aesthetic and designs for NPCs, cats, and decorations. Management-wise there seem to be no repercussions for having inadequate amenities for your cats. Some have increased food, play, or sanitation requirements but these never had a noticeable impact on how the cats acted or the utilities you required in the building.Bugs:1. Unsure if this was intended, but even though you have the ability to \"set your menu\" for the day, customers would start ordering items that hadn't even been unlocked yet and would need to be served a substitute. (I just don't really understand why someone would come to a cafe and order something they don't serve??)2.

I have tried to turn off anti-aliasing and v-sync, as well as put it on low graphics to see if it would fix anything, but it did nothing. It would crash randomly in the middle of the day and unfortunately it autosaves at the end of each day so you lose a big chunk of your progress, such as stats for your staff and cats (which are based on RNG) if the day was not completed.

Then, annoying as you realized there was only song in the game, but that's just me being petty)Everything \"stops\" really fast at the end of the day, and it screws up dialogue scenes, and if you're holding space down while this happens, you can skip dialogue by accident.

And if you don't have it, they tend to order the expensive items you do have..Which is really annoying if you were planning the next days events around using those to farm a certain group.Also, as you level up the side characters, their groups wants and comforts increase.

For example, any NPC that Moriarty controls can't be the victim (but are POSSIBLY the murderer, unless eliminated by other evidence), and are crossed off.

So you have NO choice but to give the car back unfinished; as you have no way to make money while the car is in your possession....  it costs 400$ to paint basics It auto saves OVER your manual saves, so, no going back.As a 'perfectionist' ...

This gives an incipit for our protagonist of choice to go through increasingly maddening locales, in what soon becomes a struggle for survival. In an Old School FPS, expecting an elaborate story is out of the question; regardless, there are actually a good number of documents and indirect narration elements that give out clues, tidbits about the events that went down - inspired to the Cthulhu Mythos and other supernatural cults. Despite being an unimportant requirement for this genre, the writing itself is of good quality; the same can be said for voice acting and narration - even if the voice-lines do get rather repetitive in the midst of battle, after several hours. Overall, a solid mark in this department.Combat SystemThe prime activity in FMF will be, of course, shooting heaps of cultists, mutants, abominations and everything in-between. To do so properly, you'll progressively unlock new weapons found every couple of levels, each of them using different types of ammo and having a distinct purpose on the field - although there are some redundancies. Expect an old-school feel and pacing to the gunplay, as circle-strafing and kiting enemies around while vomiting lead are the peak strategies during combat... but not always! FMF does have several levels that encourage or even force a more considerate playstyle, as they hide enemies or other hindrances behind corners, walls and such obstacles, so you can't just rush and run as you'd think. It's a nice change of pace that forces you to reconsider your approach.Both characters have four different skills; on paper, the Priest's are more defensive while the Journo's encourage aggressiveness, and this is true to an extent. Especially later on, however, the former's skills will simply prove better, as you can't really compare powerful statuses like total invincibility or infinite ammo, with a relatively miserable AoE damage or slow motion that, while useful, just don't feel as good as the holy man's feats. Such skills can be used via Madness, a mana-like stat charged by either taking or dealing damage, granting permanent charges for each ability as it increases. All feats can be upgraded to enhance their effectiveness or duration significantly, but never their core functioning. Weapons may as well be upgraded with the skill points gained by slaying enemies, with mutually-excluding patterns that transform them into significantly better - or different - murder tools. In the end there's a choice to be made between favoring better weapons or better skills, as there're not enough skill points for everything in the long run.Enemies prove varied and interesting, with each act sporting many unique variations. Some of them have weak-spots that, when hit, cause them to mutate (generally becoming weaker) and change their behavior. This rewards accuracy and know-how, but isn't really a core mechanic, as it can be done only on a handful of foes compared to the total. All enemies, on higher settings, hit like trucks while healing and ammo are sparingly found; an issue that becomes overwhelming in the last act and makes it a frustrating, unbalanced mess of bullet sponges and ill-conceived layouts.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792999356General GameplayAside from the general slaughter, you'll want to take your time in finding secrets and lore files, present in almost every level. The bounties of supplies present in hidden areas can really make the difference between a resource-starved fighter and a ready-for-anything one. With how little ammo and health there is around, especially later on, you'll soon want to become a treasure hunter, no doubt. FMF uses fixed save points in the shape of a drunken hobo, appearing once in a while to retain your progress unlimited times, but only at fixed locations. You'll also want to find color-coded keys to open doors, as it's customary in the genre.Boss FightsEach act has one boss, and all of them, except maybe one (Act 4) prove decently designed, challenging and feel unique. These powerful foes feature evolving attack patterns as they lose HP, and often spawn additional minions you gotta deal with, or soon get overwhelmed by the crossfire. It feels like latter ones are a bit too much on the bullet-spongy side, but nothing too bad in this regard. Even if multi-phased, arena-swapping in some cases, all bosses must be restarted from the start without checkpoints in case of death, which is fine.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720181Other Game ModesAfter the main story, for those who really can't get enough, endless mode is present with five unique arenas where you have to survive as long as you can with either the Journalist or Priest, against increasingly powerful foes, on a difficulty setting of your choice - while upgrading yourself and your arsenal. Completionists and achievement hunters will get into this surely, but in the end it's just \"more of the same\" without significant variations."}, {"username": "Groovy", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "The best Christian game since Doom Eternal"}, {"username": "ShamblingGoatMother", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Forgive me Father because I have sinned; I purchased off a grey market site some time ago and the least I can do now is tell you that It is indeed worth it full price off steam and leave a good review.

Moodier lighting instead of shiny and sparkling lighting FX would have lent a better feel to the visuals.Sound:Weapons sound nice and punchy, maybe a little too much so in the case of the shotgun, it's deafening. But for the most part, solid. The music is kinda generic, lots of heavy guitar and drums. More of a heavy metal rip and tear vibe than eldritch horror, which isn't bad, but it does conflict with how much effort they put into making the art so creepy and alien. Missed opportunity to lean more into horror in some sections. Voice acting is corny and mildly annoying, I played as the Journalist, and she almost exclusively spouts lame \"action hero\" one liners akin to Bombshell from Ion fury, triggered by certain in-game actions like picking up health.Story:Super forgettable. Story is mainly delivered by what sounds like someone doing their best Darkest Dungeon narrator impression. Something about following a relative or acquaintance to get a special Cthulu key, for some reason, and fight a cult for some reason. It's really bare-bones. The game is also filled with \"audiolog\" style content, little clues on the ground you can interact with to get a small tidbit of information. Calling them clues would be extremely generous though, they all pretty much tell you nothing. It's almost always some useless scrap of mundane information that you don't have the context to understand or care about. I doubt even serious lore nerds will find themselves getting invested in hunting for these little nothings. I stopped checking them about 2 levels in. Doesn't matter much for a game like this, but worth noting.Gameplay:The shooting is crisp and there is good hit feedback on enemies. Popping headshots is satisfying because of the gory animations. It's fast paced and requires constant movement and quick and accurate shooting. Hitboxes can be a little finicky and hard to hit sometimes but for the most part the shooting is solid fun. A lack of alternate fire is disappointing, right clicking is instead the dedicated \"hold up flashlight\" button which also puts away your gun. This is only used for the predictable gimmick sections where they shut the lights out and you have to use the flashlight briefly to navigate. This really only happened right after the flashlight was introduced, and I basically never used it again. I chose hard mode for my first playthrough and that seems decently balanced for a first run for an experienced fps player, but I have noted some major flaws as I've progressed through the game. The first being the upgrade system.     You gain xp from killing enemies, and when you level up you get a point to unlock an upgrade from a tree with some branching choices. These range from simply gaining more health or armor to completely changing one of your guns into a different version. This is where some problems arise. Upgrade are permanent, you are locked in as soon as you select them. This would be a fine - if slightly annoying - design decision, if it weren't for the fact that these \"upgrades\" aren't always upgrades. I decided to \"upgrade\" my mp34, a reliable long range machine gun, into the grenade launcher variant. Once you have this variant, ammo for this weapon becomes extremely scarce, I found only one or two packs of 5 in very long branching levels, with multiple keys and sections. The grenade launcher must be extremely powerful right to justify this scarcity? No, not really, it's pretty weak. It has a narrow hitbox for direct hits, mediocre damage, and a very small explosion effect. A direct hit on common mid-tier enemies will result in dealing 2/3 of their health, and you only have around ~5-10 shots per level. Those kinds of enemies appear by the dozens. I could kill about 100x more enemies with the original, un-\"upgraded\" version of the weapon, as it was strong and had plentiful ammo. This is not the only example of getting locked into a downgrade either. I decided to try out the \"throwing knife\" upgrade for the basic knife. Whoops, this reduces the knife from a solid but risky fallback melee option, into what basically amounts to throwing pebbles at enemies. Throwing knives travel slowly in an arc and deal about 1/20th of mid tier enemies hp bar per hit. I'm in the middle of act 2 and I've essentially already deleted 2 weapons from my arsenal by locking myself into crappy versions with the upgrade system. Thankfully, not all the upgrades are like this (the eldritch shotgun upgrades are awesome and powerful) but for an upgrade system to be fun, investing points should always result in getting stronger or having more options to play with, not nerfing yourself. It wouldn't be so bad if you could redo your points or even unlock multiple variants, but right now getting stuck with a useless weapon for an entire playthrough is just extremely disappointing.      Unfortunately, this problem of giving the player weak tools carries over to another major aspect of the gameplay, which is the active abilities you can use every so often by racking up \"insanity points\". The list of abilities sounds cool on paper, an angelic life draining sword berserk mode, a camera flash that stuns enemies close to you, a voodoo doll that nukes in an AOE around you, and a temporary slowmo effect. These abilities should result in a cool big moment of power where you use them to turn the tide in your favor temporarily, and to an extent they are that, but they are mostly too limited to be really satisfying to use. The sword power up for instance, really suffers from the finicky hitboxes in the game. For some reason they decided that the hitbox of the sword would be exactly 1 pixel in the center of the screen that can hit exactly 1 enemy at a time and only if you're close enough for them to hit you back. The sword deals a decent amount of damage, but only restores ~10 hp per hit, and most enemies on hard mode hit for at least 20-40 damage per hit. This means that instead of resulting in a fun cool moment of slicing through hordes of enemies while stealing back health, it's actually almost never a good idea to use this power. All they would have to do to fix it would be to make it cleave across the screen instead, with a decent reach and ability to hit multiple enemies. Immediately, this power would be fun and cool to use. Similarly, the camera flash sounds decent on paper, but enemies have to be basically right next to you for it to work at all, and thus stunning enemies is rarely useful because most melee enemies are fodder and die in just a hit or two from any of the non-terrible weapons in the game. It's a flash effect right, why not just let it stun everyone looking at you? The voodoo magic explosion is fine, if a little underwhelming, and the slow-mo power is just about the only one that feels strong to use. Unfortunately, even this is hampered by the fact that you can't use any power in combination with the others! Why! Being able to slow down time to position a voodoo explosion, or go on a slow-mo rampage with the sword would actually make those powers more fun, but for some reason, you are limited to 1 at a time. Final thoughts:     It might sound like I hated played this game, but honestly, it's fine, I had some fun. It's just very frustrating that with some small tweaks like buffing some useless weapons, improving the power of the abilities and letting you use them in combination, and allowing you to respec or unlock multiple weapon variants would result in a experience that is way more fun. It's difficult to recommend this game for $20 when something like Dusk exists, but maybe if they come back and make some balance tweaks with an emphasis on improving the fun factor of some core features it wouldn't be."}, {"username": "sl0thb0ss", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "A shotgun enthusiasts wet dream.

Then it keeps on going and going and going. Pre-determined save statues meant that to be competitive, I had to wander back to old save locations (if they existed at all) and back to the action. The progression system of skill points has all but dried up by this point, requiring thousands of kills to improve the character. I was a fool to invest in the 'quicker xp gain' powers, because it turns out there is a soft cap in obtaining more.At this point I was no longer having fun. I had a choice - stop playing or crank the difficulty all the way down. This did not help too much. It does not make enemies less tough, just less damaging. There was barely enough ammo to kill everything, and it was certainly excruciating to progress. I decided to run past every single non-essential enemy. It worked and I eventually found my way, level by level, to the final two bosses. The bosses were fun. All of the bosses are fun and reasonably challenging on normal. Shame about those final levels - they could be fixed with some tweaking."}, {"username": "cHaoS", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "I really want to like this game. And it was great fun in the first few chapters. But then it began to become worse and worse. While the gunplay is decent, the weapons are fun and the enemy visual design is great, more and more flaws started to accumulate. It ended with me running out of ammo in chapter 5, so I could not continue to play. The enemies become more and more bullet sponges. And while it wasn't a big problem in the first levels, it became more and more annoying how little sound the enemies make. They often spawn behind you or out of sight and you only realize that they're there, when you are hit with a volley of projectiles, losing half your health. As I said, the visual presentation is really great. But the atmosphere does not fit a Cthulhu Mythos game. Unfortunately I can't recommend this."}, {"username": "Enigmatic Salp", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Pros:-Fantastic gameplayThis game just feels good.  You can headshot most enemies, which is highly effective, though there are enemies who have clever work-arounds with it; such as a zombie that carries an extra head it puts on after you shoot off the first, or an armored enemy with exposed fuel tanks you can shoot to partially melt him.  There are also a lot of enemy varieties, which helps keep gameplay feeling fresh.  Even a guy who throws exploding fish!-Good level designLots of secrets, great looking environments, and many unique encounters make each moment enjoyable, and re-enjoyable.  A great example is an early map in the second episode, in a graveyard.  There are mostly low-tier zombie enemies, but lots of tall grass.  You can hear them, so you know they are present, but finding them before they get close takes effort, and you have to watch your back.-Solid weapons (all of which are useful)I find myself using every single weapon I've gotten so far.  Even the melee!  The starting pistol is weak but accurate and great for headshotting low-tier enemies to save ammo.  The only downside I'd have to say is some sound a bit weak, but not every gun can be the Super Shotgun from Doom 2.-A lot of levelsTwenty-five maps?  Feels like an old 90s shooter!  Loving the amount of levels.-Amazing Boss FightsI've faced two so far, and they break the stereotype of FPS games having lame or weak bosses.  These are masterclasses in good game design, IMO.-Great priceGame is a third the price of a AAA title and feels far more polished than one.Cons:-Some guns sound weakJust as it says.  I wish they had a bit more heft to their sound, though it's not a dealbreaker.-The Voice acting is badPerhaps they were going for old-school over the top, but it leaves a bit to be desired.  Fortunately, you can skip most of it save for the one-liners during gameplay which are tolerable.Neutral:-There's an upgrade system.Feels a bit out of place in an old-school FPS, but it's reasonably implemented, I suppose.  Even with the \"get more XP\" talents, leveling seems very slow.  I wouldn't say you even get one per level.-The story is just . . . there.Lots of \"story\" prompts around maps and beforehand exist.  I like Lovecraftian horror, but I've not been too interested in them.  It exists, is all I can really say about it.-There are two classes with recharging abilities.Another thing that seems more modern, there are two classes, one more based on offense and the other more defensive.  They have abilities that recharge as you kill enemies.  These powers are generally good and borderline essential on higher difficulties - I'd say they're well done."}, {"username": "Kal", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "A dude threw a fish at me and I died.Joking aside, Forgive Me Father is a pretty good \"boomer shooter\". It just got released and needs a bit more polish to be great (notably in its tells ; the enemies make very little sound so it's hard to tell when one sneaks up on you, and there is no indicator when you take damage of the direction it came from), but it's still very enjoyable.One thing, though. The store page advertises its \"lovecraftian ambiance\". That is NOT true. A lovecraftian ambiance would mean making slow, deliberate progress while being in constant danger from incomprehensible horrors that will kill you, while being surrounded by strange secrets. In this game, you zip around at mach 3 and shoot the horrors in the face with a shotgun, turning them into fine red mist, and read a few scattered notes here and there while your character makes quip. You certainly are in a lovecraftian world, but the ambiance isn't there. This is NOT a horror game.

There's a lot of cool features for progression and overall replayability, but unfortunately the actual content you play through is very lacking.For me this is mainly because of how boring the areas get and how grindy they get. The areas aren't necessarily bad but every single area is so huge you're spending hours finding the exact same encounters, constantly having to heal or run back and if you decide to skip encounters you'll quickly be really underleveled. This especially shows on the \"boss\" fights - where you just get permanently status conditioned, get your stats dropped and are expected to heal 30 times throughout one battle where the boss has 10 times your HP and just spams the same 2 moves. The story is also not my favorite, being very slow with every conversation pausing for 3 seconds after every 3 textboxes to show an animated emoji - and the characters generally feeling super bland and unlikable to me.The gameplay, creatures and battle system all work well but all the actual content makes it such a drag to play through I'm afraid I'm giving up on the game after getting this far, as it doesn't look like it will get any more engaging."}, {"username": "battlexon", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Imagine if Pokemon required some thought to complete the story mode...congrats, you did it!

Awesome game!"}, {"username": "DualShot66", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Read my Full Game Review Here - https://quoramarketing.com/coromon-review-a-new-monster-taming-game-for-pokemon-fans/Coromon is a monster-catching, pet battling game that can be easily mistaken for the more popular and viral games on the market right now. However, it was just released so people are bound to be a bit confused at first, but in no time they'll be joining the waves of fans that adore this amazing game. There's just something about creating a team of cute monster friends that intrigues and lures one in. Coromon is a game that has hidden away in its heart the spirit of old-time monster taming RPGs.What might seem like yet another \"copy and paste\" product hides more than a surprise, thanks to fairly layered gameplay. If you are looking for a fun adventure, difficult at the right point, and with an atmosphere reminiscent of the Pokémon chapters released on the iconic Game Boy Advance, Coromon is therefore the game that could be for you. The game, which has just released on 31 March 2022, is available on Microsoft Windows via Steam as well as Nintendo Switch.The game itself is a turn-based RPG, where players will battle monsters, collect more monsters, and level up their monsters on their journey. The combat system is reminiscent of old school RPGs and features a “rock paper scissors” style mechanic that rewards players for exploiting elemental weaknesses. While there's a great variety on offer here, it should also be noted that some of these Coromon is a little lazy in their design. Most of them look fantastic -- they're all very colorful and have their own distinct characteristics making them easy to tell apart -- but there are a few that really do look like they've been copied and pasted from other games. That's not the case for all of them -- most are wonderfully designed -- but in terms of art direction, it's clear that some were given more attention than others.There's also a unique aspect to the monster taming mechanic. It's called \"Potency\", which is a random stat that can be applied to every single monster in the game. What makes it special? Well, there's a chance that you'll capture monsters with higher than usual Potency (0-21), which means that you'll need less XP to level up your Coromon and get free stat points! , Standard Coromon appears 97.09% of the time (3101 to 3194), Potent 2.88% (92 to 3194), and Perfect 0.03% (1 to 3194). This feature was introduced with the purpose of adding more variety to the gameplay. While standard monsters will be sufficient for most players, those who want something extra can try their luck and look for more powerful creatures!The first thing we notice, when playing a game, is the visual design. We see characters and scenes that tell us a story and inspire us to play on. The second thing we tend to notice are the animation sequences — they help create an atmosphere, go hand in hand with the art style and can really make or break a game. In a game like this, the pacing is super important. And when you're playing a game that's as heavy on interaction like this one, you have to be able to play it at any pace that feels comfortable. This means that there are some battles that are going to be longer than others and certain parts will come off the bat faster than others. There's no way to speed up the animations, but there is a \"skip\" available. If you've been watching animations for too long, it might feel a little strange at first to skip them and jump right into a fight with your party of Monsters fully healed and ready for combat. You're always going to have some level of repetition with combat, no matter what you do. But it's important not to make this feeling too much of a chore. Coromon seems to have failed on this aspect as it features lots of prolonged battles, unnecessary chores, an excessive number of puzzles, and excessive grinding for leveling up your Coromons that at times kills the excitement and thrill to progress further in the story.Coromon has way too many RNGs ( Random Number Generator ) for it ever to be interesting competitively. Because of this, Coromon is far less appealing than other Pokemon-like games which are clones or have similar features. Random Number Generator mechanics detract from the skill involved in the game. Even though there is an element of luck involved in any battle, when random number generators are involved there is a much greater chance of a player winning or losing because of luck rather than skill. This can make teams and battles feel less interesting because good movesets and tactics are often not enough to overcome bad luck. Even in single-player games, random number generator mechanics are neither satisfying to win with nor do they feel fair to lose to.Unlike Pokémon, Coromon has no trading or co-op, so the only way to get more monsters is to beat them up and claim them for yourself. Trading is something the entire potential and traits system can really benefit from, thankfully TRAGsoft ( Developers of Coromon ) have expressed an interest in adding it in future updates but for now, players will have to live without it.  I do have a few suggestions. First and foremost, I would like to see more variety in Coromon types as it feels like you can only get so far with one type before you're forced to swap out since every type has its strengths and weaknesses.I also feel that you should be able to switch out your Coromon buddies in battle as I often found myself with a party that wasn't suited for the area I was currently in and then would have to backtrack all the way to town to swap out for a better party. Though this may just be me and what I'm used to from other games like Pokemon, it is something that would definitely make the game flow better.The combat system feels a bit clunky and frustrating to use especially in some of the later dungeons. It's not uncommon to get chained into 3-4 attacks while trying to get away, but I feel this can be addressed by adding some sort of dodge roll or I-frame, especially when all your Coromons have fainted and it's your last and only Coromon left.Overall, Coromon is a fun game for those who are fans of Monster Taming RPGs or Pokemon games. While it does have some issues, the overall quality of your gaming experience will be determined by what you can and cannot tolerate. If you can cut the game some slack and look past the flaws then it should be enjoyable.

I got really excited after seeing the premise, weird, unique, interesting occurrences in the west. It sounded extremely fun and an immersive sim at that!

Something a bit more interesting than, \"oh wow, look at this crazy creature you've never seen before! Now kill it.\", would have been awesome. Zombies event, shoot em. Cultists summoning a creature shoot em. Bandits robbing you shoot em. I don't know maybe there were other ways out of these events, but why care? I can just reload the save if i die, and if i don't kill them ill miss out on loot.

Unfortunately the combinations rarely come into play because the gun battles are so hectic and consist mostly of either sniping people with the silenced rifle perk or spam rolling and shooting.While there is some character progression, it's mostly pointless because every time you go to the next story you go back to zero. It's also very easy to find weapons that are better than anything you can craft yourself so picking up anything else than healthkits and dynamite is pretty pointless and the constant inventory management if you pick up junk feels like a waste when it only serves to get you more bullets. As soon as I restarted with the second character I lost the will to do any sidequests or exploration because you keep losing all your stuff.The game feels like it has some cool ideas but it's just half-cooked and after a couple hours you start seeing through the mechanics. I don't regret buying it, the first character felt like a pretty neat experience, I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. If you want to play through it just to see the stories I can get that, it just isn't for me."}, {"username": "UR|Zuzuzu", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Turns out, after all those years, Fallout series were immersive sims, who knew?This here is a spiritual successor to classic Black Isle RPGs, although, admittedly, simpler in many ways. Still, a decent and welcome experience, fun to crawl around, looking for ways to get inside and steal stuff. Detailed, crisp, and tastefully stylized visuals help with that.Tactically, it's sort of twinstick that heavily incentivizes using stealth, cover and elevation. It's rather mediocre due to limited area size and wonky combat camera controls, so people expecting pure action would likely be disappointed, but it is complex enough to be fun. Plus you can get up to two mercenaries who can wreck stuff for you.Interesting unconventional story structure: without going into spoilers, you get to play several premade characters in a row, with separate agendas, abilities and goals. And they are united with an overarching conflict, of course.Overall, it lacks scope (budget, price tag, what have you) to be a loud masterpiece, but within its' weight category it's an interesting and fun piece. Definitely recommended."}, {"username": "PwnBroker", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "100% worth the price tag. (As of this review I have done 1 play through and contemplating another run.)Pros:- The heroes encourage multiple play styles without completely gating the player.- Variety of game mechanics (vendettas, zombie plague, location changes during transition, superpowers) solidly integrated into gameplay loop. (Some appear as optional encounters)- Choices do have consequences. Like many games the ending cutscene is based on the major choices; but, unlike most they have medium and smaller choices that will affect the world in much smaller ways. (mostly \"cosmetic\" and after hero transition)- The stories are decent caliber for modern games. Nothing you haven't heard before; but, I'm a sucker for murky morality.Cons:- Not a whole lot of content. Take your time and enjoy the exploration and game mechanics because the main story could probably be finished out in a few hours.- When I say choices, I mean life or death. Pretty much nothing matters unless someone lives or dies. You can ghost an entire town, if you so please; and it'll become just that (after hero transition.)- The murky morality I referenced earlier is pretty shallow. Same as the overall story. Most definitely enjoyable but not winning a Pulitzer anytime soon.- If you don't kill people (especially named NPCs) some game mechanics are totally wasted.- The hero transition can be a bit off putting. While you can get keys, relics, and carried inventory back from prior heroes you lose bullets, money, and horse. Not a biggy especially since the bank transfers over, but a bit jarring at first. To the devs: - If you could get inventory from a prior hero without needing them to join your posse. Or if relics, keys and maybe money were in the bank.- I would definitely snag an Essex campaign as DLC"}, {"username": "J0ust", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "I want to like this game. It has its heart in the right place, it has great art direction, an intriguing setting, and it's from developers I respect. That said, it feels like the framework or foundation for something more, maybe a proof of concept, and not really a finished game in itself. It is repetitive, it is undercooked, it is buggy, it has meaningless crafting, awkward controls, and underwhelming combat with pistols and rifles being the only weapons worth using, This is all exacerbated by an isometric perspective that looks good from a distance, but which doesn't really work in practice. I'll look forward to Wolfeye's next game, I'm sure it will build on the lessons learned from Weird West.

I put 60 hours into the PS4 version and almost 40 hours into the PC version when both of those releases originally came out.I should also say that if you're expecting a huge difference compared to the original release (if you played the original release) then you will be disappointed. I'd say even for a 10 dollar upgrade it feels a lil expensive for some new gameplay additions, but I also am a very big fan of Hideo Kojima's games. Every time that I play one of his games, I play it differently on every playthrough because there is a wide variety of tools at your disposal that will let you play your way, which is why out of all of his games I love Death Stranding: You have point A and point B, but the route you take and what you take with you will be different compared to others.Strictly speaking about Directors Cut, I love the new gameplay changes. Melee combat is a more varied, the support skeleton at the beginning of the game helps make the first 5-10 hours of the game a lot more tolerable, the firing range allows for experimentation before applying it to your arsenal, there's a lot of LITTLE things that make a bigger difference compared to the original.Now, since it's called Directors Cut, I have to mention that there is no new story content at all. There are a few new required missions that you do, as well as some neat new cutscenes, but they do not change the story at all, just the actual progression of the game. If you are expecting the story itself to be fixed because you hated the Princess Beach stuff, you are going to be disappointed. There are some changes to some of the interviews, but that's really it.If you've never played Death Stranding before, then yes, Directors Cut is still very much worth it. 40 dollars for a 40+ hour game without doing the side content is still an incredible deal for an incredible game. If you've played the game before and wasn't too much of a fan of the gameplay, I'd say give it a shot because the gameplay changes are drastic enough to warrant a replay.If you played the game before and hated the story, don't bother. This isn't here to fix the story, the Directors Cut isn't really a Directors Cut, it's more of a MGS3 Subsistence update, where it's just adding some extra spit n shine onto the game  and making it easier for people to get into, while adding some new little things to entice past players to come back and have another run through the game."}, {"username": "THE_KING-2-5", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Let's start off by saying this game isn't for everyone even I didn't like it when I first played it on ps4 few years back, but i gave it another go on pc and I don't know what I was thinking back then the game is amazing, the story the gameplay everything I couldn't stop playing."}, {"username": "Dune Drifter", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I love this game, fantastic graphics, brilliant story-line, outstanding characters, you can really feel the dedication, heart and soul that The KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS team have put into this game.

Can you handle journeys in solitude, punctuated by terrain challenges and occasional encounters with hostile creatures? If so, then you might enjoy this.

I recommend you read the full review for the full detail. This game has a lot going for it!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've waited until the game's full release to write this. As of today I have 179 hours in this, and I've beaten the game 4 times. I think I can write this review pretty confidently lol.I bought this game after seeing Civvie's 2 videos on it. It looked like so much fun I had to try it...before I knew it, it was 2am and I had no intention of stopping. Even now, it remains just as enjoyably addictive. This is just as well, because the game goes on forever. Literally, forever. With the Chapter 3 update, New Game + was implemented, and you can play this game with progressively stronger weapons and enemies for as long as you want. Even if you don't decide to play NG+, you've still got at least 50 hours of levels and bossfights- that's about how long it took me to finish the game for the first time.But what about the details, Mantha, the DETAILS?! Very well: 3 game-modes, 3 minigames, 3 chapters, featuring 80+ levels, with 80+ weapons, and 50 enemies, officially-speaking. Technically, there are 25x as many levels, if you count all their variations (each level has a set of variations you can encounter. If you die and retry a level, the layout will be different), and for the weapons, there's...technically, there's like 1000+. All the different combinations of modifiers (including my favorite, \"Random projectile\") make for very, VERY different weapons. For instance, on one of my saves, I have a shotgun that shoots explosive fireballs. Another shotgun I have uses explosive pellets that deal shock damage. Yet another shotgun I had is able to shoot on automatic, has 3 extra shells, and does ice damage, which can freeze enemies solid. So in reality, the amount of different weapons in Nightmare Reaper is innumerable. As you can probably tell, this aspect of the game is my favorite. I I love collecting new, wild, powerful weapons in games, especially when each one feels and sounds satisfying, as they do in Nightmare Reaper.Speaking of sounds, have you *heard* the soundtrack for this game? Listen to the trailers, watch someone stream the game. The music is fantastic and matches the mood of the dream-based slaughterfest...oh would you look at that, it's by Andrew Hulshult. That explains it. As for other, non-musical sounds, the weapons all sound gorgeous (the sawed-off's alt-fire is how every shotgun should sound), to the point that sometimes I start using a weapon not because it has particularly strong modifiers, but because dammit, I really love the way it sounds. You will also enjoy the sounds of the enemies, who each have various idle sounds, alert sounds, pain sounds, and death sounds, all of which make the killing even more satisfying.How about the graphics? Every game's gotta have shmexy graffix, right? Nightmare Reaper does not disappoint. Its pixel-heavy retro style may put off the zoomers who have no appreciation for art, but for those who understand the uniqueness of old-school sprites and textures, this game delivers. Modern lighting and shading techniques coupled with lovingly-made textures give each level its own particular atmosphere that you simply have to play to fully feel. ...Okay, this section of the review sounds like a snobby game journalist wrote it, but I stand by my words! It looks great. One of my favorite things to do is to sneak up on enemies and just study the way they look. Gaunt, the man responsible for the enemy designs, made some eerily, disgustingly-beautiful creatures.What about the story? What is all this dream stuff about? Why are you in a mental asylum? Who are you? Da ♥♥♥ is going on? If you've read my reviews before you know I abhor spoiling a story, so don't expect any. You play as an unnamed young woman who has lived a...rough life...and has developed some serious mental scarring that's left her with a struggling grip on reality. She experiences vivid nightmares, in which the player can find small clues and hints as to her past, and how she got to this place in her life. During her waking hours, she is left notes by her doctor, which serve to explain the story in more concrete terms. Ultimately, the battle for sanity is fought in her dreams.Lastly, I want to talk about the smaller, less fundamental things. The game has lots of settings, so you can customize graphics, UI, controls, and even gameplay to a fair extent. The minigames act like skill trees, helping you become more powerful and gain new abilities, so they aren't just bland bonus features. There is also an arena mode, where you can take the outrageous weapons you find in the proper levels and test your might against endless waves, while also earning currency to spend in one of the minigame skill trees. There are also secrets to find in the nightmare levels, most containing various references, and upon clearing out a large room of enemies, special \"events\" can occur...some good, some not so good. The game keeps you on your toes! And finally, perhaps the best aspect of this game, its community. The Nightmare Reaper community, specifically the Discord server, is a joy to hang out in and be a part of. It's especially fun talking to the developers...even if the lead dev has some questionable hot takes on movies here and there...and seeing people post clips and images from their experiences in the game. To conclude this lengthy lad of a review...Nightmare Reaper is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome and anyone who enjoys the FPS genre should try it. Seriously, it's that much fun that I can confidently give a broad and sweeping recommendation like that. If you enjoy running around, playing with fun weapons, jumping, shooting, and fighting monsters, you will very likely enjoy this game, especially as the levels grow larger and more complex. It's fun to play, it's full of good music and satisfying sounds, it's got lots of those \"little touches\" that make it all the more enjoyable, and the community surrounding the game is a big ol' family of videogame nerds. What's not to like? :DTo ItBurn: Congrats on finally finishing your passion project. I hope you take a well-earned rest after this.

He can also take advantage of curses and even debuffs for extra versatility. - Slime Boss, more of a setup-based character, can Split into various types of slimes which have effects at start of turn. Overflowing on slimes gives you 1 Strength, making a slime spam strategy very tantalizing. Slime Boss can also stack on large amounts of Goop to deal ridiculous damage with one attack. - Guardian is more defensive, and essentially is Body Slam Ironclad on steroids. With easily available Block and Barricade and incredible cheese potential, you're going to have a lot of fun taking zero damage. - Hexaghost has a set of Ghostflames which trigger their effects after a certain condition is met, such as playing two Attacks. Adding to this is a new Afterlife keyword which lets you play a card as it's Exhausted, plus a new Poison-like status called Soulburn which deals insane damage after 3 turns. - Champ is basically Watcher for people who don't like taking 30+ damage after miscalculating their turn. While his Stances do nothing on their own, some of his cards have a Technique keyword, with varying effects depending on which Stance you're in. - My personal favorite, Automaton can Encode various cards into its Sequence, temporarily removing them from its deck cycle. Once 3 cards are in the Sequence, they're combined into one Function with the effects of all 3 cards. You don't need me to tell you how ridiculous this can get. - Gremlins consists of 5 different characters, who you can switch between with various cards. They each have a passive effect which can shape your deck, but make sure the Gremlin you're focusing on doesn't die. - Since no StS mod would be complete without a meme character, Snecko revolves around luck. Lots and lots of luck. Central to its mechanics are Unknown cards, which turn into random cards that satisfy a certain condition at the start of combat - including cards of a different class. Good luck.Adding to this incredible amount of content is the new Downfall mode, which essentially rewrites how an StS run is expected to go, mostly in ways that are best experienced blind. One of the more interesting changes in my opinion is the map - in Downfall, you start at the top of the map and travel down, with the boss at the bottom. However, the map's procedural generation isn't modified to take this into account, meaning that you will start each Act with a campfire, and there will likely be multiple enemy fights right before the boss. This makes boss fights, especially early bosses, much more stressful, as you might not be entering with full health.Overall, I highly recommend Downfall to anyone who is even mildly interested in more Slay the Spire content."}]}, {"game_id": "1485080", "game_title": "Just_Act_Natural", "overall_score": "- 86% of the 395 user reviews in the last 30 days are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Action", "Multiplayer", "Casual", "Arcade", "Character Action Game", "Shooter", "Stealth", "Arena Shooter", "3D", "Cartoon", "Cartoony", "Colorful", "First-Person", "Hand-drawn", "Comedy", "Sniper", "PvP", "Indie", "Free to Play", "Early Access"], "reviews": [{"username": "Boethiah", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Fun"}, {"username": "Biggus Dickus", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "just act natural"}, {"username": "DOGCLOPS", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "This is my favorite hide and seek game, It is tons of fun with friends or in public lobbies.

I also enjoyed the flavour text and reading all the descriptions and KK Notes in full. I know this can be boring and tedious to some people but that's why if you want to not bother with it, you can just play through the story. The story is of a mad scientist and his efforts into separating the soul from the body  but focused around a young man fused with a ghost who was one such soul separating from his body. They team up to kick ass and reverse the separation and put everyone back into their bodies. It's a very quick story to get through and the ending got me super emotional. Tears lined my face I tell ya! I would be interested in a sequel of sorts to see if Akito (young man protagonist) continues to vanquish otherwordly foes or help those with spirit problems. Definitely room to expand the world or leave it as it is.I think it's a lovely game for sure. It balances campy with grit very nicely but won't be a game for everyone.

Game/play is stale you just pew pew with your fingers having an abundance amount of ammo and healing items , standing still absorbing spirtis (WOW) and playing mobile/game type minigames in order to break seals to acquire even more spirits (SUGOI !!!!!). I would not recommend this game to anyone even if you are utterly bored there are better things to do than play this janitorial fest, even cleaning your own house feels better after only 2 hours of this game. Trust me this game has some time traveling gimmicks on it since playing only 1 hour literally feels like you have played 10 . Again i am a victim of my OCD and i need to complete this mundane task in order to move in to the next one, really coming after Elden Ring into this piece of bland crap felt like a punch in the face. Quest design is as simple as it gets go to A spot grab this come back go to B spot etc ,actually the best quest in the game is to hand toilet paper into a spirit and i am not even joking about this.About the story of the game i honestly forgot it had a story bellow this crap collectathon , so i guess it's pretty forgettable if i cant remember it even if i am literally playing the game while writing this review.In all irony though some of the spirits while you roam the open world utter the words I AM SO BORED and i could not agree more with them.TOILET PAPER TOKYO 3/10"}, {"username": "ShrimpuHa", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Well, good graphics, beautiful map, cute shiba and that's all.Lack of gameplay, very repetitive combat. It gets really repetitive really quick.Basically you wander around picking up souls and cash. Every shops are basically selling the same item. Even for an open world game, you do not feel like going back to where you have been since it basically has nothing to discover.Most of the shops are background element (non-intractable). Also, limited side quests. Side quests content are just MEH.The mainstory was Okay. No WOW factor at all.-----TLDR; I'd prefer re-run Cyberpunk 2077 or Witcher 3."}, {"username": "Solid Gamer", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "★☆☆☆☆ TerribleFar Cry 2: TokyoThis is without a doubt the most disappointing game I've played this year.First off, I went into this game with the perfect mindset. There is so much wrong in this game that I can't understand how someone could give this high ratings. There is not a single pinch of love put into this game that I can feel. It feels like the only person that really wanted to make the game was Ikumi Nakamura (the ex creative director of the game) and when she left, the other devs were forced to finish this game which created this cesspool of a video game.When I saw the combat through the gameplay trailers, I was excited. It looks great and the animations are badass then I saw the amount of elements and I was like \"Wow, can't wait to see what other badass attacks I can throw at my enemies\". The fact that there are only 3 elements and each of them only has 2 attacks, light and heavy. THAT IS IT. For a 10 hours game, this is pathetic. The skill tree is a joke. Even with there being only 3 elements, I was still somewhat optimistic. The upgrades are boring and dreadful. \"Increase the width of your water element attack from 1m to 2m\". There's also nothing for the melee department. There isn't anything like summoning a fire sword that you can use against enemies. This is creatively bankrupt and it shocks me that the man who made this studio was Shinji Mikami. It is embarrassing that his name is now put into this game.The combat also doesn't improve with the poor array of enemy types. The enemies have cool designs even tho most of them look identical. The way their attacks are choreographed are all quite different. The flaw here is that 95% of enemies require the same way to kill which is by spamming everything you have at it. Only one enemy that actually forced me to change elements and that is the fat shield guys because you gotta use the water elements since it's like shotgun. This just makes combat way more bland than it already is. This world is the definition of empty. The map screen is so cluttered with icons: there are telephone booths everywhere in this game, why did the developers have the need to place all of them on the map screen? Same goes for the flying demons. They felt like they need to show everything on the map, no matter how badly it effects the experience as a whole.The worst aspects of this open world is definitely collecting spirits. There are a total of 240000 spirits you need to collect (probably 35-40 hours of all game). How do you collect spirits you may ask? Well, you hold the right mouse button. You do this for every single spirit you find. And then there's the side quest which I gave them a chance. In this game, you talk to random souls that all have the exact same design. There is absolutely no way for anyone to be interested in whatever is happening to these people.95% of buildings in this game you can not enter and when there are, it is stopped by a loading screen and you're teleported into the building. What year is this? Am I back in 2012? Even Yakuza Kiwami fixed this problem long ago. What a joke.Story: the most generic anime plot to ever exist. Blank protagonist who cares for his blank of a sister who is working with a blank detective to save Tokyo from a blank villain. That's the best way I can put this story. The acting is also weak, the amount of overacting in this one is hilarious and no scene will even touch your emotions.Ghostwire: Tokyo the only way to describe the game comes in mind = colossal disappointment!"}, {"username": "Astracus", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I finished this game yesterday, and I really did enjoy it.I 100%'d it in about 36 hours, completing the achievements wasn't too hard, except for the RNG one, I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hated it.The graphics were really awesome, and it seemed well optimized, until I got FPS drops randomly, where it'd go from 20 to 70 FPS, while I used to get a stable 130/144FPS while not bugged, but it'd eventually get fixed by itself after a few seconds, except for a couple of times where I had to restart.I really did like the story, you don't have choices to change the ending like in other games, but still very enjoyable to me, even if kinda short, didn't exactly feel rushed, while I played all the side quests while doing it, but I guess somebody who played the main story only would feel like it is.I read a lot of people who complained about the combat system, calling it repetitive and stuff, but I didn't find it boring, it was fun to me.So overall, I'd really recommend this game, and if you're scared about the \"horror\" part of it, I didn't find it particularly creepy, there was only one single jumpscare in the whole game too, so shouldn't be that big of a deal."}, {"username": "KawaiiAngel-chan", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "The amazing visuals and great enemy designs kind of carry this game's lacking gameplay and writing.

The PC Port is really bad to the point that it ruins the game experience.If you take a look closely at the Steam reviews, almost all positive reviews are just people simping for Adachi. Most of the real reviews of this game are negative due to the terrible port.P4AU itself is an incredible game, very fun to play with excellent characters and a very colorful, flashy and vibrant visuals.My PS3 broke due to a power surge that came from the network cable in a stormy day about a month after P4AU got released 9 years ago so I could never play it since then. I was really excited to finally be able play it now in current-gen hardware, especially on PC, but unfortunately the awful port ruined my experience of this great game.There are several random crashing issues in different modes, very inconsistent audio volumes that are either inaudibly quiet or freaking loud, plus video playback issues (init render and separate \"active movie window\" pop-up).The developers didn't even bother to upscale the game graphical assets from 720p to a higher resolution.Online matching crashes when searching for rooms with more than 2 slots and when it finds any rooms there are like only 3 people available. Ranked works but I can only find like 4 people with a 0 bar connection. I understand that this game is not popular in my region but I was expecting to find more than 7 people online at launch day.Lobbies have been removed in this version for no real reason.Atlus completely trolled us all at launch by unlocking the game 5 hours after the Steam page release time.The game is expensive for a bad 9 year old \"remaster\" and doesn't have regional pricing. I decided to buy it anyway because I'm a big Persona fan and I was really excited to play this game that I could never play for 9 years. The game itself is excellent, but the terrible PC Port and the big number of issues alongside a bad delay based netcode completely ruined the enjoyment of the game.Maybe I'll reconsider buying it again once rollback is implemented and the issues are fixed, but for now I can't recommend P4AU in it's current state. The negatives are greater than the positives and I felt a big disrespect from Atlus this time.

It's fast paced, frantic, technical, has a large and diverse character roster, and is just plain fun. This is on top of being a love letter to personas 4 and 3, with a fairly decent, and canon, story mode to play through as well. With all of that being said I was very disappointed in this port having the issues it does have, because I wanted to see this game get a second chance in the spotlight. While I haven't ran into nearly as many issues as others have, there are still some very OBVIOUS issues that ANY PLAY-TESTING would've revealed instantly. Very bad audio mixing making the FMVs and random sound effects incredibly loud compared to the rest of the game, and generally poor online performance. From my experience it was mostly fine during matches although due to not having rollback yet, random stuttering will happen, and that is not ideal at all for a technical fighting game of this nature. If that wasn't bad enough, simply trying to get into a match and find players who you haven't played against before can be a real hassle. Also the game ran perfect from my experience, but I have friends who had the game run unplayably slow, despite having great PCs. This sucks because not only is it a gamble on the game FUNCTIONING for you, but for whoever you may want to play with as well. I just straight up can't play this game with some of my friends until they fix the optimization or whatever is causing this. All of this being said, it makes me very upset that this game wasn't handled with the respect it deserved, and was clearly rushed to meet a deadline. The player base is already pretty small, and I can very well see these issues making people drop the game or not want to pick it up entirely.

Must buy for adventure fans."}, {"username": "Max", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "(originally published on Gamepur.com)One of the first games I ever owned was The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, on the original Game Boy. It looks laughably dated now — it did come out in 1993, to be fair — but it’s got a special spot in my heart to this day. I still get that rush of nostalgic exhilaration when I think about the exploration and mystery baked into that game, and the hours I poured into my Game Boy Pocket over the Christmas of 1996.Tunic, from developer Andrew Shouldice and publishers Finji, wears its influences plainly on its sleeve. It’s easy to see the inspiration it’s taken from the Zelda series, particularly Link’s Awakening. The main character, an adorable little fox, wears a green tunic and wields a sword in one hand, a blue-and-red-patterned shield in the other. You even start off by waking up on a beach and must piece together the mystery of the island on which you’re stranded as you progress through the game. The art style, too, is reminiscent of Nintendo’s remake of Link’s Awakening from a few years ago, with its simple but lovingly-crafted visuals.This is no mere copy of a more established game series, though. Tunic has an astonishing amount of depth to it, and the elements it borrows from other games, whether aesthetic, narrative, or mechanical, all serve the game’s own unique identity.At first glance, Tunic is a fairly straightforward adventure game. You wake up on a beach, find a weapon, bash some monsters, and just have a good old explore. There’s a lot of Zelda DNA in there, but there’s also a significant amount of Dark Souls as well. Perhaps it’s considered gauche to compare things to Dark Souls these days, but the parallels are undeniable. From the dramatic and tough-as-nails bosses, to the shrines scattered about the map that serve as checkpoints, and even to the initial objective of ringing two massive bells, it’s clear that FromSoft was not far from the developer’s mind.Combat will be familiar to anyone who’s played an isometric Soulslike. Enemies telegraph their attacks with just enough of a window to let you react accordingly once you learn the tells. You have to manage your health, stamina, and, later on, magic bars accordingly. You can roll, at the cost of a bit of stamina, and the invincibility frames granted during that animation will be key to surviving encounters. The bosses are absolutely brutal, but with patience and a little bit of luck you’ll be able to feel that intoxicating sense of satisfaction in taking them down. There are a couple of little quality-of-life and accessibility options available too — if your twitch reflexes aren’t what they used to be, you can turn on invincibility or infinite stamina and just enjoy the story or hunt for secrets.That brings me to the other major way that this unassuming little adventure cribs from Dark Soul: its approach to story and secrets. Where other games may hold your hand and guide you gently through your quest, Tunic leaves clues for you to piece together, crumb by crumb. Most often this takes the form, in a delightfully meta twist, of pages of a retro instruction manual for the game itself. With gorgeous hand-drawn art — also evocative of the promotional material for early Zelda games and the like — and intriguing things scribbled in the margins for the eagle-eyed, these collectibles are a joy to behold. Scattered all across the game, they will introduce players to basic concepts and bits of lore as well as providing a jumping-off point for the myriad secrets waiting to be discovered.The obtuse way that Tunic handles even basic game concepts may well be a sticking point for some players. I enjoyed figuring it all out immensely, but when information like how to level up stats and what certain consumable items do is hidden away inside collectible manual pages, there’s certainly a risk of alienating some players. It should be added, too, that the manual features only a bare smattering of English (or your chosen language) across pages upon pages of an invented and impenetrable language — potentially a point of confusion or frustration for some.Still, the important stuff is fairly easy to parse, and the charming illustrations and pleasingly soothing music help to take the edge off if you’re starting to feel confused. The publishers have also made it clear that they endorse and encourage a bit of good old-fashioned community discussion when it comes to deciphering the game’s lore and secrets. In the press Discord server the team set up for the purpose of sharing strategies and the like, it almost felt like we were back in the schoolyard, swapping urban legends, outlandish theories, and secret codes. Except this time they actually yielded results, which was a wondrous feeling.In the end, despite the debt that it owes to series like The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls, the game that kept springing to mind as I worked my way through Tunic’s late and post-game was Lucas Pope’s Return of the Obra Dinn. Tunic obviously features a lot more action and hack-and-slashing than Obra Dinn, but the sheer depth of the puzzles and secrets tickles that same bit of the brain. Everything you need to know is right there in front of you, hiding in the folds of the environment and the manual’s marginalia — you just need to figure out how to piece it together. As enjoyable as the combat and the main story were, it was the puzzles that I couldn’t stop thinking about, and the feeling of solving each one was practically euphoric.Tunic’s cutesy aesthetic and tips of the hat to other games serve almost as a jumping-off point, a familiar-feeling touchstone to draw players in. Beyond that, the experience is entirely its own, with satisfying and challenging combat, secrets that gradually unfurl, and a quiet and contemplative story with its own twists and revelations. It’s a beautiful and polished little game that asks a lot of its players at times, but it has every confidence that they will rise to the occasion. As the game’s creators put it: “Keep your wits about you and be brave, little fox!”"}, {"username": "Gavitro", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "This game is an experience that is several layers deep, but sadly I spoiled some of those layers for myself because it was a little too difficult for me.

Yes? Then chances are good that you will love this game.Because really, Tunic is two games: a souls-like, and THEN a puzzle game. In that order. Sequentially. As in, once you beat the souls-like, then you play a puzzle game.See, there are two endings. To get the first, you play a souls-like: fight and explore through a series of challenging dungeons and bosses culminating in a tough final boss. I loved this first game! In particular, it's absolutely jam-packed with hidden shortcuts and treasures. The surprises-per-hour rate on this first game is very high, and I was constantly delighted.And after 11 hours of joy, I beat the final boss, and got the bad ending. Enter the second game: a series of puzzles you solve to get the good ending. Is it a BAD series of puzzles? No. But it's not really what I signed up for! The skills I built over the prior 11 hours were made completely irrelevant by this puzzle game. The puzzle game took me about 5 hours, after looking up two specific things. I am dumb, so had I tried it blind, I absolutely never would have gotten the good ending. The choice to lock the good ending behind a second, totally different game is an interesting one. Artistically, I respect the hell out of it. But I didn't really enjoy playing through it.

At the most surface level, its a sort of fusion of the best of the 2D Zelda games with a 'Souls-Like' combat system/philosophy.  That is you go around and explore, find new weapons and tools, unlock new areas with them, and then fight things with brutal and extremely punishing battle mechanics demanding split-second timing of dodge rolls and blocks.Of course, that is only the surface, if you dig down a little deeper you start to find the kind of ridiculously unraveling puzzles that games like The Witness are known for.  Suddenly you start looking at things you have been seeing all along your adventure but with new eyes which recognize hidden meanings, secrets, and all new ways to progress in the game in mechanics you didn't even know existed just before the discoveries.  Then you find even more secrets, even more new systems and methods of play and things really begin to unravel and rebuild in your mind in entirely new ways.And with all of that said, I have focused so much on the mechanics that I haven't even begun to describe the aesthetics.  The visuals are absolutely nothing short of one of the most stunning uses of stylized minimalist 3D that I have ever seen.  At times its so heavily stylized that you begin to lose track of it being 3D at all and it begins to look more like a carefully hand-crafted 2D world of the type that was seen in the heyday of early iPad type of games where things almost look painted and placed, only for your sense of the 3D world to come racing back when you dart around a corner and the camera/perspective does a relatively rare shift.The audio is similarly stunning and the ambient smooth music reminds me of the best of games like Fez where each area has its own theme and the music itself becomes part of the presence of each zone as you wander through it.  From melancholy soft melodies in abandoned ruins of cathedrals to relatively zen synth and almost chip tuney notes as you make your way through forests and gardens.Tying everything together is the in-game manual which has the perfect look and feel of the absolute best manuals of the 8 and 16 bit eras, subtly showing you mechanics and information in a mysterious language you can't hope to comprehend but with bright bubbly visuals and the pencil/pen notes of some unknown previous player to help guide you along.  You only gradually find and assemble the pages for this treasure and each one is a revelation that can open up entire new game mechanics you always had access to but simply did not know about.  The single most enjoyable treasure among so many in this game that you get to experience is the glimmer of yet one more new manual page on the screen which you can then greedily jump into and pore over, zooming in and out to unearth all the information, secrets, guidance, etc that it can have for you.Oh and the entire game is absolutely riddled with foxes among which your character is absolutely the cutest most inspirational and wonderful example and you cannot help but fall in love with their plucky little can-do attitude wonderfully emoted through every little movement and animation as they dart around and run through grass, fields, cliffs, water, etc.  No matter how brutally hard the game gets you can't help but dive back in to help this little fox get just a little further in their quest to... something something!In short yeah this game is honestly right up there in the hierarchy of some of the best indie games that have ever been created, among the company of Fez, The witness, Braid, etc.  Its an absolute treasure and whatever your personal gaming proclivities, you are doing yourself a dis-service if this does not make its way in to your library (and your head-space)."}, {"username": "Suule", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "********Don't believe the specs - it runs on Win 7********If you're looking for that classic Top-Down Zelda experience you might find it here.

Capturing an aesthetic that is just enough of an homage to be present while clearly forging its own identity, Tunic is a joy to play. Its art direction is charming, unique, and consistent throughout though the variety of setting is rich. I found hours melting away as I explored and played. I wanted to see what the game had next, what there was to discover, what secrets the next milestone would reveal, what new and exciting sights there were to behold. I was never disappointed.Half of the impetus to continue exploring was the absolutely stellar soundtrack by Lifeformed and Janice Kwan. I bought the album a mere few hours into the game. The pair have put on a clinic in an OST that's warm, haunting, foreboding, catchy, and sublime throughout. Not to be left out, Power Up Audio has also done an absolutely outstanding job giving the game and its interactables and combat punchy, rich, and powerful sound which remains consistently good throughout.I cannot touch on the story without being vague to avoid spoilers simply because of how rich it is and how important discovery is to the flow of the game. Prepare to be amazed, then amazed again, and again. Chasing the dragon of discovery will be rewarded, guaranteed. The gameplay loop is challenging, but walks the razor's edge of being punishing and rewarding as you become more practiced and confident. It's not souls-hard, but damn near, and the rewards for your endurance are abound. It does not disrespect your time or pound you to dust.All in all, the game is a STEAL at $30. Buy it.

There is Pokemon, with IV breeding, Sonic Adventure with the Chao Garden, Planet Zoo... and then there is Wobbledogs.Wobbledogs scratches that itch in a way that the other games can't. At first glance the game doesn't look like much. It's very rectangular, very wobbly, the music is repetitive, and there isn't a significant amount to do. But it makes up for what it lacks in sheer number of legs. See, the point of the game is to crossbreed the lovable near-gelatinous dogs over and over until you've created an abomination worthy of its own entry in the Monster Manual, and from what I have seen the community is still debating on if there are any limitations besides your own hardware. You can just keep breeding more legs onto them. More heads. More tails. Or have a dog with 3 heads, one wing and no legs. I bred a table once.While the dogs(?) aren't having their DNA shoved into a breeding simulation machine of questionable reliability, they live in very cute and customizable habitat cubes that can be connected with hamster tunnels. Furniture items can be easily unlocked by capsule balls that are... dropped by your dogs(?), and there are many ways to create unique and fun habitats.Wobbledogs are also virtual pets requiring care and attention. You need to feed them, clean up their excretions, pupate them as they come of age, and account for their mobility issues as you breed them into non-functionality. What you feed them has an impact on how they grow and mutate, so you do need to take care with their diet. Your reward for this hard work is a single unfertilized egg, which can be used to make more abominations. After that they either live in storage for all eternity, or they exist until they die. If they die after you did a good job taking care of them, it rewards your other dogs(?) with a \"feast\". Actually it does that if you did a bad job. This game isn't very punishing.There is a very simple way to save and share your dogs, so you and your friends (or random strangers) can crossbreed your unique abominations together into some sort of obscene collaboration.Overall this is a really fun and addicting game. The art style grew on me, like extra legs, and the gameplay is simple and doesn't have much depth, but it is entertaining enough to hold my attention.

You'll enjoy the gameplay, you'll find it's wacky customizations hilarious and will have a blast putting cat ears on The Undertaker, or downloading Donald Trump off Community Creations and having him wrestle Batman.However...if you're someone like me, a huge wrestling and video game fan who has been a fan of the series for many years...I just don't know.  I've described my views on this game as generally 50/50.  For every time I've been annoyed that a feature is removed, I've seen a bit of attention to detail that has me audibly saying \"Wow.\"  Hands slapping the steel steps in entrances make a great noise, the commentary is MUCH improved and they often talk about specific history or style matchups between the two specific wrestlers in the ring.  They put a lot of time and care into these aspects of the game to make it FEEL like not just another rehash of an engine they've been using since the very first Smackdown! game for the playstation 1. So, if I have all of these great things to say about the game, why am I also displeased with it?  I'm going to list some missing features, inaccuracies that are inexcusable, and other things I've noticed that..I just can't justify.No D-Generation X.  The music is not there, HHH's entrance motion isn't there that I've seen, no entrance video.  I can forgive them removing custom entrances for a year \"because it caused bugs in 2k20\", but why remove options and templates for superstars still in the game?No retro versions of characters already in the game in other forms.  We have current Kane, but not retro.  We have current bald HHH, but no long haired 90's or 2000's version.  We have 2006 HBK, but no 97-98.  All of these characters were in last years game...Which...brings me to the reason I've seen that they've been removed.Myfaction.  They have removed these aspects of the game to place them exclusively in Myfaction mode.  You can't use 2001 HHH in universe, but you can pay real money or spend countless hours to play as him in their card based, pay to win or grind it out mode.  To me this is the ultimate greedy money grab technique, and has me wanting to boycot this franchise.Jeff Hardy's music no longer aligns with his entrance motions when he begins dancing.  HHH's music no longer aligns with him spitting the water.  Why?  That was a detail that has been right in EVERY SINGLE wrestling game for years, all the way back to the ps2.  Why is that suddenly wrong?MyGM is back, but extremeley limited.  No secondary titles, only a men's a women's title with limited matches per card.  If I literally can't have a mid-card title, I just don't see the point in a watered down version.Most of the DLC wrestlers have literally been in the game, some as recent as 2k19 or even 2k20, yet now I have to pay to have them again?  YOU LITERALLY REMOVED WRESTLERS FROM THIS GAME FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT, TO HAVE THEM AS DLC?  Rob Van Damn, Yokozuna, The British Bulldog and others have all been in recently, and I can't believe I haven't seen these things being complained about in other places.As far as the gameplay goes, not having a single counter button and having to match to what type of grapple they are doing makes it to where I can't keep my finger on a single \"no\" button as I call it, and just perfect the timing and instantly counter everything thrown at me.  It makes matches a bit more challenging, and something I've enjoyed.  I DO NOT agree with their claims that the controls have been simplified this year to allow more people to pick up and play.  Perhaps it's that I've mastered them in years past, but this control scheme seems more complicated than every, though I've gotten used to it.I have ran into some bugs and random crashes.  Hollywood Hogan's leg drop finisher does no damage and is difficult to get a win with.  I've had my finisher bar freeze so that I can no longer tell how much momentum I have.  Downloaded arenas off of Community Creations do not show up when I try and select them in Exhibition mode, but they are there when I try and put them on a show in Universe.In conclusion, if all of these little..off details don't bother you, then by all means, get this game.  Enjoy.  Just don't pay them a DIME on Myfaction, and be wary if you are like me, a long time series fan looking for details that you just expect a game like this to have.  Again, absolutely no reason to have HHH, HBK, Chyna and X-Pac in a video game, but no D-X entrance.  Inexcusable.

I do not say that lightly. I have written positive reviews of divisive, at times maligned products, as they managed to meet my own expectations.I have great respect for the craft of gamedev and what goes into creating these experiences. With rare exceptions for purposes of humor, I do not review flippantly. But I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, except to a highly select audience.I give Visual Concepts credit where it's due. They've inherited a series from a dev team who worked on it for decades, and during some very difficult circumstances, managed to produce a reasonably functional and stable game that does an arguably acceptable job of exploiting the series' strengths while adding some interesting twists to the formula. And they did this after taking two and a half years off following the troubled launch of WWE 2K20, to try to get it right. I commend them for that, and for creating what is a reasonably enjoyable experience when it works.The new MyGM mode, though limited compared to classic GM modes, has been a surprise standout for me. Setting it up, trying to figure out what will get the highest ratings, and managing a show budget are unexpectedly addictive.This year's Showcase, a historical career retrospective focusing on Rey Mysterio that stretches from WCW to his current stint with his son Dominik, is fun and doesn't overstay its welcome. Transitions between archival video footage and angle-perfect gameplay in that mode are a fantastic presentational touch. Along with the period-accurate visual filters and lighting used in many of those venues and broadcasts.While not a fan of combos, and most of what's on offer here is a mere reshuffling of states and actions with different inputs, the new control scheme is likely beginner-friendlier.Each of the game's modes - from the card collecting MyFaction, to MyGM's management options, to Universe Mode's full micromanagement of everything, to MyRise's branching career mode - feels distinct, self-contained, and in and of themselves fun. Unfortunately, a lack of cross-mode integration was step one in my inexorable spiral toward frustration. I spend a lot of time in these games' creation modes. I spent days carefully creating my custom CAS, which I planned to use in MyRise. Maddeningly, that's not something 2K22 permits. You cannot import a created superstar into MyRise. Nor can you export your MyRise character to other modes.Putting care and effort into a CAS is a sizable time investment. Having no way to use them in this game's career mode is simply not a user-friendly design. Recreating them entirely for MyRise is just as bad.I ended up making a cartoonish CAS I threw together in moments instead, because it simply wasn't worth the effort.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784244540I then moved onto MyFaction. I found it enjoyable. You create a deck of cards representing specific superstars, and then play them in matches to level them up and unlock additional cards. Some cards reveal otherwise inaccessible superstars, such as classic versions of characters. Except... yet again... these unlockable characters cannot be used outside of MyFaction. It's counterintuitive, and killed any sense of payoff for grinding.These odd limitations litter the game. There are no tag team or mid-card titles in MyGM Mode. Promos have been removed from Universe Mode. This year's custom entrances are far simpler affairs, with many important options gutted entirely, supposedly to avoid issues present in 2k20.And unfortunately, that brings me to my single biggest issue with this release. \"It hits different!\" That's 2K22's slogan. \"Redesigned engine.\" These are things you can read on storefronts. Yet while more stable overall, the game is packed with the same legacy issues that have plagued the series for years. And some new ones. The title screen failed to acknowledge any input for nearly 40 seconds if I downloaded too many community creations. Load times when using created superstars and arenas grew to 4 minutes. There is clipping through body parts during entrances, despite tight limits being placed on entrance creation and other measures supposedly introduced to avoid this. Hair looks and animates just as jankily and rough as ever. Many In-game superstar faces look less accurate than community creations do.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2788025464Online play is marred by lag and disconnects (which costs rewards.) There's no variable refresh rate support. Texture quality is a greyed out setting that only changes if you change your display resolution (and even then only if you have above an unknown VRAM threshold.) Altering attires for existing superstars introduces permanent geometry warping on in-game models. As in 2K20 there is a soft limit on total user created images before issues emerge. Once exceeded, images on downloaded wrestlers simply vanish. Nothing warns players of this. I worked for days on a CAS only for one eye to become permanently frozen (more wasted time, & this is an old bug.) Universe is buggy (custom arenas don't save to shows consistently, invisible wrestlers attack you, titles don't change hands as cutscenes say they have, etc.) Bugged custom belts are blank.Then there is the UI and general user experience. The editor has flashing selection highlights that cover fine details and can't be disabled. Minor accessibility features enabled by users don't work online. UI leaves some players uncertain what to do in MyRise. I could go on.The cherry on top? Losing 100+ hours of progress & creation work to a simple reinstall. Something no other Steam game has done to me.ConclusionWWE 2K22 is a game I wanted to love and I have the hours to prove it. I'll likely continue the struggle to extract enjoyment from it. But in its current state it doesn't feel like it respects my time, money, or intelligence. For every moment of fun, there is a frustrating restriction or technical flaw that makes it a grind to get the most out of. There have been some very high profile \"worst launches ever\" in recent years. Yet those games were islands of functionality and stability in comparison to this one. They got hate-trained, while actual broken annualized sports IPs get a pass year after year. Enough is enough.I've played this series for 22 years. This is now the third time a return to form has been implied in some way. And it's the last time I'll bite unless things demonstrably improve."}, {"username": "MIZUCHI", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "joe biden from the top ropes"}, {"username": "Cheeto", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠛⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠋⠈⠀⠀⠀⠀⠐⠺⣖⢄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⢀⡆⠀⠀⠀⢋⣭⣽⡚⢮⣲⠆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⡼⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣅⣨⠇⠈⠀⠰⣀⣀⣀⡀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣟⢷⣶⠶⣃⢀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡅⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⠀⠈⠓⠚⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡠⠀⡄⣀⠀⠀⠀⢻⠀⠀⠀⣠⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠐⠉⠀⠀⠙⠉⠀⠠⡶⣸⠁⠀⣠⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⡆⠀⠐⠒⠢⢤⣀⡰⠁⠇⠈⠘⢶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠠⣄⣉⣙⡉⠓⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣤⣀⣀⠀⣀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿THE BROCK"}, {"username": "live mas", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Totally awesome targeting system. I love multi-man matches taking 45 minutes because the targeting system does not work correctly. Try playing a 4 Man Extreme Rules match and watch. AI loses its mind in Elimination Chamber matches, it simply does not know what to do. It breaks up pins, submissions, and even most basic moves because it is HELLBENT on attacking the person its targeting no matter what. AI will often all target the same person (usually the player), leaving you to deal with a barrage of 3+ AI who will not fight each other. Makes it near impossible, you can only counter so much till it becomes tedious.Oh speaking of reversals, the combo system. Instead of reversing them like you would normal moves you gotta guess which face button the AI will press to reverse those. This is not the worst system, but its not great. Leaves a lot of time to just sit there while the AI does what it wants to you, there is no button prompt to give you a chance either. Timing be damned.Some moves are completely bugged, I can knock the tag partner off the apron with a running attack maybe 1/10 times, not because they reverse. The move just misses, completely. This is one example, there are many, many more.GM Mode should not have been put in this game. It is simply incomplete. Focusing on Universe Mode changes and continuing to work on GM Mode for the next game should have been priority. Oh well, needed to sell this game to customers who got burned on the last one I guess, and this was an easy way to do it.The game isn't the worst, it isn't even bad I feel. Not as good as the peak games in the 2K franchise (14, 18, 19), but not as bad as the worst (15*, 20). I'll continue to play, as I feel it has hope in a way 2k20 never did. It is fun, mostly. When it isn't completely frustrating (not in a difficult or intriguing way, but in a \"Who let this through testing??\" way). However, this game feels about 70% done. I won't even talk about crashes or optimization, as many other people already have (yeah its not great). Hope the next game in the franchise expands on what 2K22 has started, there is a lot of potential meat to be added to the bones of what this game has to offer."}, {"username": "The Djentleman", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I've been having fun with the WWE games since Smackdown: Shut Ya Mouth on ps2. So far I've had a blast with this game, my biggest concern in recommending this is that apparently people are having terrible crashing problems and such but I've yet to have any issues like that. So far the worst problem I've had is after saving a custom character I have to wait like a good minute for it to save. If you're interested I'd say give it a shot and see if you get crashes, if so then refund before it's too late and wait.    EDIT: Doubled my hours since first review and so far I've had one MyRise crash only, I barely play that compared to just basic play now and universe mode though."}, {"username": "daveybird48", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Plenty of Hits, a Few MissesI decided to wait a week before I wrote this, to try out the features and not have a knee-jerk reaction of \"it totally rocks,\" or \"it totally sucks,\" after a day or two. It's pretty good so far, but obviously far from perfect. I'm gonna break it down by the hits and misses of every mode I tried so far (and usually play/use every year)Gameplay:It actually plays really smooth and responsive, in contrast to the prior Gen 8 WWE games, which felt less like playing it and more like pressing the buttons and joysticks and watching them wrestle. New control scheme and match style isn't too bad. It feels like they wanted to make it easier for the newcomers, who don't know what they're doing, and just button mash until they find what works, and give them a momentary advantage over the veteran players, who know what they're doing but keep reaching for the wrong buttons, until their muscle memory re-adjusts. I like the new grapple system. Don't have to worry about how long you hold the buttons. But I don't like how everyone has to have only one payback, and how many abilities are tied to it. Overall, it feels like a fun, solid party fighter/wrestling game/sim. I don't sweat it when it comes to gameplay for pro wrestling games. It's based on a staged sport, and as long as it's fun, and looks somewhat like what we see on TV, I'm a happy camper.Hits:-Fun, fast-paced, beginner-friendly system -Streamlined grapples without losing much from prior-Controls are more responsive, easier to move and attack-Blocking now has its own button-More enjoyable overall for party/couch matches, or even the diehard fans who open up to it-Mixed Tag Team is back and it works, fully the first time for Current Gen (not counting 2K20)Misses:-Special abilities are a little too streamlined -Still no button configuration for gamepadsGraphics:For the most part, graphics received an upgrade. Looks like they have a new lighting/shader system. Really enjoy how you can use the video board crowd for the ThunderDome events, wonder who volunteered to shoot for the virtual audience. However, there are some downgrades. Certain outfits clip through the wrestler/each other worse than before. Custom images don't have a material select option like at least 2K19, so they're all glossy at least for now. But not too big of a deal. I haven't found a time of day option for the outdoor arenas, even though there is in the Create an Arena mode. Also, it's a little irratating whenever a user gets stunned or hit with a finisher, the camera view has a red outline. It would be nice if that were added to the graphics or presentation settings. Because it can get in the way of your view, or just be distracting. But like I said, sometimes I want it. But I'd like to turn it off when I don't, especially if I'm playing a local VS match (don't think it happens to your online opponents when you do it to them). The biggest issue I have with the graphics is an animation glitch. When some wrestlers clench their fists, their fingers curl way too much, like, several times. So much for 2K bending over backwards to fix WWE 2K's issues, now their fingers do that, too. But something tells me that won't be permanent.Hits:-Shading upgrades -Social Distancing Crowd Option -Dead Pixels (random black splotches) from the PC version on NVidia cards are now gone.-Frame rate during match is faster for the most part...Misses:-User UI features as described above that are better off voluntary -Social Distancing Crowd not available for Created Arenas, even if you choose a ThunderDome-No Custom Image material options like before. Custom Images also appear a little grainier, I believe.-Fingers glitching out beyond the Uncanny Valley.-...Frame rate can drop drastically during closeups and camera cuts. I turned them off for the time being.-Backstage is more detailed, but limited. No more locker room, photo room, cafeteria, office, or fleeing wrestlers when you run past them, at least to my knowledge. But you can still zoom into what is available, and relish in its detail.Creation ModesOne of the biggest reasons I play the WWE 2K games is the CAW and other modes by now. That's been the main draw for me since the Smackdown Vs Raw days. Not only can you create a lot of wrestlers and characters, but the CAW Server for downloading others' creations online never disappoints, you never know who or what you might find, or how well they might be made. I like the increased amount of body types. But your wrestler's weight is now tied to it, unlike before. Also, there's no more fine-tuning of limbs, with their size and tone. Hopefully these get added back in with a patch or at least 2K23. But not much of a deal breaker for me, as at least the sizes are still realistic. My CAWs are going to be fluctuating between weight classes, though. It's not like I have to memorize every setting like previous titles, though.Hits:-Custom portrait sounds good not only for use of real photos but displaying special notes about moves or outfits.-Image uploader was fixed within 24 hours of its official release date.-Better descriptions of arena venue size options to help us memorize them.Misses:-Video board on small studio arena shows upside down on the other side, a nightmare for photos, camera closeups, and replays.-More body type options, but that's where it ends. No limb or tone customization like before.-No weight customization aside from body size.Replays:For those wondering, you can still pause and free rotate. About the same as 2K19, but a couple of improvements. You can zoom in and out further for more FOV, and particles (spit/sweat) are back in replays. Of course, like always, I want the option to remove the ref or one or more wrestlers, but I'm not surprised they aren't there yet.Hits:-You can still pause and free rotate -Particle effects are back inMisses:-N/A, no downgrades so farUniverse:The fantasy sandbox mode returns with its ups and downs. I brought back my own league, Simulator Championship Wrestling, from 2K18 and 19. The setup for the universe was actually pretty quick and straightforward. The new season of SCW premiered and I got to playing and managing it. I won't go over modes like MyGM or Showcase, because I haven't tried them yet, and they're usually not what I play in these games. You're better off trying them for yourself or listening to those who have already played them and are interested. Modes I want to try but haven't, I'll get back to them afterwards.Hits:-Quick setupMisses:-No promos (speaking in the middle of the ring)Conclusion:WWE 2K22 hits different, for better or worse. Most of the problems I mentioned could be fixed in patches for this game, or maybe even the next (2K23 or possibly 24, they know by now it's worth the wait). It's not the besf or the worst, but it looks like 2K Sports is finally on the right track. As Yuke's is developing the AEW game, I'm excited for that as well. Hopefully both developers will compete and motivate each other, just like the pro wrestling leagues are back to nowadays.I would give it an overall 7.5/10. Glad there is another playable current-gen console/PC Pro Wrestling game. As always, there were things they added, and things they removed, but they're getting somewhere.TL;DR: It's a solid title. Far from perfect as usual, but it's playable and customizeable.

The \"rebuilt engine\" brings a massive amount of cutting corners with it. If you expected to enjoy many features that have been present in WWE games for the last 20 years, you'll be disappointed to find a lot of them missing here.Weapons and other physics just don't act properly, and you can't do barely anything with them. Just swing them around like an idiot. Tables fold up if you barely touch them. The backstage area is utterly BORING to fight in, because you can't do stuff like you used to, throwing people into car windows and through doors. On a gameplay level, the game is so vanilla and boring, you're only getting a couple hours of entertainment out of it at best.Tons of other missing features. Advanced entrances - which have been a cornerstone of these games for over 15 YEARS - gone. Story mode, which was promised to be this great big branching storyline thing... is so, so boring, and reduced to a \"pick your opponent\" thing. Nothing interesting ever happens in it. I put a significant amount of time into it, and it's just the same thing over and over.Lastly, the optimization, hit detection, and input detection are just an absolute mess. You get massive slowdown with more than 2 opponents in the ring (don't even attempt the Royal Rumble), and when it reaches that point, the game just isn't playable. Hits and grapples don't register, and you just clip through the ropes and opponents. It.. is... bad.I am very disappointed for what this game is, because it could have built on something and 2K missed that opportunity, then sold us snake oil. 2K19 was the last good one.

The goal is to travel to all points of interest and make a picture.The game has a late 90s PC/Playstation aesthetic, but where it really shines is the sound design.

The player begins as a mind inside a bulky, mechanical body, separate from it. But by just playing, by experiencing the, and, through the body; we begin to replace our senses. Our sight becomes almost null, just a few glimpses that more often than not show us nothing but void, our touch; just a couple of lights on a radar and our limbs; the buttons on the panel. The only one that remains unchanged is our hearing, which is the most reliable, consistent and, unfortunately, the truest of them all.The coordinates and the pressing of buttons just became natural, i began to juggle with them absent-mindedly, just like walking doesn't require mental strain behind every step. But hearing... My sense of hearing never fell into my subconscient, for it warned me faster, more consistently of the threats that came to me, like one hears a possible danger before feeling it up on their leg (such as watching the radar lights flare up rapidly and turn off again in an open space in the tunnels). Just like opening our eyes in a sleep paralysis, trying to catch that final gaze into the darkness; reaching for the camera at the last node, unveils the horrific truth... already too late.Iron Lung is a perfect example on how to put the player INTO the game and truly experience terror as if it were on our own, true skin, leaving behind jumpscares that only appeal to the eyes behind the screen and only show shock and tension through mechanics."}, {"username": "Faust", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "If you have played any of David Szymanskis older titles, you probably know what to expect. As in The Moon Sliver you're journey to what seems to be your goal, might ultimately end with something you're either already expecting or rather not think about.If you've never touched his games, you can expect a short experience which is in return for it's rather little playtime boiled down to the core essence of what makes a horror game great, at least in my opinion. The setting tells it all. You're alone, navigating a small submarine in a blood ocean on an alien moon. You can't look out of the window, only take snapshots with your camera.There is no marker on your map so you'll have to navigate via coordinates. I actually liked this idea and the game itself isn't so long that it starts to get tedious. You'll have to take a certain number of pictures to complete your mission. An alarm is kicking off when you're getting to close to a wall - and it never stops until you're increased the space inbetween. The sense of danger, of dread and the classic fear of that what lurks in the dark and can't be seen - yet heard - makes this little game very special. The soundeffects are very disturbing and well placed, making your claustrophobic situation even worse. Even though there is literally no replayability I highly recommend Iron Lung for its great atmosphere and unique gameplay.

I started and finished Iron Lung while waiting for another game to download.

The lore here has the potential to be incredible and the gameplay, while a bit rudimentary and plodding, compliments that story pretty well. Unfortunately, it ended up making me long for a more fleshed out story with more in-depth mechanics. The game, as it is, is pretty bare-bones.However, I'd say that its atmosphere and premise, along with its genuine uniqueness, are enough to sell this game. I truly hope that it's expanded on at some point in the future."}, {"username": "Neonetik", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I must admit, I'm likely going to be a little biased when writing this review. I absolutely love the idea of deep sea horror, and Iron Lung captures this pretty well. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Iron Long, even if that time was a little under an hour. Yes, this is a short game, but thankfully, it doesn't really feel like there's all that much filler here.  That being said, I do not think this game is perfect, and I have to admit I was a bit disappointed by the end of things. I will be sure to mention when I get into spoiler territory, but just know that if you've played some of David's previous works (not going to say which one until later), you might be able to guess why this title might be just a little disappointing. But hey, let's cover the good parts first.For those who have not read the description of the game on the store page (why wouldn't you, it's right there?), you play as a convict welded shut in a submarine, send into the depths of a blood planet, to discover something that may help a doomed world. The premise is simple, and there's really not much story beyond that and a small letter, but thankfully, that's not the point of the experience. The point is the atmosphere and tension, and the game succeeds quite well in this regard.You navigate the submarine using only 4 buttons, along with a map that has a basic outline of where you need to go. Using coordinates displayed in the submarine, along with your map, you have to determine where you are, and navigate the world through numbers. The planet is made of blood, so even if the submarine had windows, you wouldn't be able to see jack. You also have a camera at the back of the submarine that you can use to take pictures of what is directly in front of your submarine, but this isn't really helpful for navigation at all, as is primarily used to accomplish the objective of taking pictures of the key points on the map. I have absolutely 0 skills when it comes to navigation, and have an exceptionally hard with with directions of any sort, but even I, after just a few minutes, was able to grasp this system very quickly, and had 0 problems with it for the remainder of the game. Determining where you are is easy, and figuring out which way to travel was simple.The game is visually and aurally quite excellent, at least considering what it's going for. I'm not saying it has some super advanced graphics or whatever, as they are reasonably basic, but the presentation is top notch. There are several moments in the game where audio is used to elicit an intense fear, and by golly, does it work wonders. There were several moments in the game where the only thing I could think was \"I need to get out of here right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ now.\", so hey, massive props there. It's a hard thing to pull off, but the game did it. The limitation of visibility is also very effective at making you feel totally at the mercy of whatever is around you. Despite never actually being able to see anything outside of the submarine, the game is very good at making you feel like there is a whole world outside of the sub that you just can't see, and while using the camera isn't particularly helpful for navigation, it does wonders to reinforce this feeling.There are problems, though. Mostly small ones, but problems nevertheless.Firstly, the game allows you to switch to an FoV of 100. Given that the default is something like 65, I turned this up all the way immediately. Bad mistake. If you turn it up this high, there are several spots in the submarine where, if you turn in a certain way, parts of your view will clip into the submarine and look really weird on the sides of the screen. Kinda immersion ruining, I must say. If you could change it back in game, I wouldn't have too much of a problem with this, but you can't. You need to quit the game to do this, and that sucks, because that brings up another issue.Throughout the game, various things will happen to the sub. To give a very small example, a pipe might rupture a little, and start giving off steam. It will remain this way for the whole game, as will other things that happen during the trip. Quitting the game and loading back in, however, completely removes all of the various things that have happened to the sub since the start of the game, essentially starting you off with a brand spanking new machine, largely invalidating the tension of feeling everything start breaking around you, including some of the more intense horror aspects of things that occur. If you play this game, you basically have to beat it in one sitting to get the full experience. Quitting mid-way and starting up later will really, really screw this up for you.Bringing up the map as well is also a bit annoying. If you want to see where you go, you need to open the map, mouse over the right location, see the 3 separate 3 digit coordinates values, and then start moving you sub to get to them, but remembering 3 3-digit numbers at once, while also needing to figure out exactly where YOU are at that moment, which includes another 3 3-digit numbers, takes a moment, and sadly, each time the map is closed, the cursor moves back to the middle of the screen, meaning you need to mouse over back to the right spot, every single time you open the map. It doesn't sound like a huge deal, and it isn't, but it is irritating, and could have been made easier in several ways without impacting the game negatively.But really, there's only one (what I would call) major issue the game has, and that's the ending. Spoilers ahead. You have been warned.If you've played Squirrel Stapler, and felt disappointed by the ending in that little title, then you're probably going to be disappointed here. The last part of the game involves you getting to the last nav-point, going to take a picture, and then a giant fish/monster suddenly and loudly breaks through the submarine and the screen fades to black. It's a jump scare. That's literally it. You have just played for an hour, and experienced all that effective horror full of tension and distress, all for a jump scare.What the hell.The game then ends, and one last bit of story text pops up, and that's it. I tried pulling a trick at the end by loading my last save and then keeping my eyes to the front of the sub to push the button, but the developer thought of this and made it impossible to do so. Fair enough I suppose. That's also how I discovered that other issue of all submarine effects disappearing.I have to say, I really did expect better. Squirrel Stapler I figured was only made the way it was due to a time constraint, but as it appears, no, that's just what David finds scary. A giant face popping out at you and making a loud noise and then a jump to black at the end of a game. I understand that this, in a way, is done to give all the previously effective tension a purpose, and to reach that last climax, but to me, it feels very lazy, and I felt like the limited story had the potential to pull a really cool and disturbing twist at the very end, which could have made the feeling of discomfort far longer lasting, but no. All there is, is a jumpscare.I know many like this sort of thing, but I do not. As such, I consider this a pretty sad mark on what is otherwise an very well crafted experience.Iron Lung is not a game for everyone, but I imagine that the vast majority of people who give it a shot will walk away pleased the took an hour out of their day to have the experience of playing it. I love deep sea horror, and hope to see more stuff like this in the future, and will certainly continue to support David's work. I just wish the potential in this title was realized just a little more than what it was.Want to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator!

Most notably, Thief Simulator, which was released a couple of years ago. So perhaps you can consider this game the third-person version of it.If you have not played that like myself let's continue! You play as Jack who ends up in the prison of a small town following an awful heist. As somebody wants you free you are given the key to your cell and asked to escape, get to a motel and also to get your towed car. These first couple of missions can be considered the tutorial of the game.After that you end up in Bar 66 where you meet Stacks. He'll give you a lot of missions and following his storyline is the way to complete the Prologue. Now, what are these missions? They are jobs and are all about stealing something. It can be a precious guitar or just a special whiskey some consider invaluable. You are free to explore the town in a Grand Theft Auto-like fashion meaning you can always hop in your vehicle and drive around as you see fit. The best of the game for me was the preparatory session. Each job (or robbery) requires careful planning. The game keeps feeding you with tips as more and more items or tools become available. You learn how to disguise yourself as an electrician, how to sneak, enter with the use of a hammer or crowbar and how to escape the police. You need to see a corrupt cop to get your heat lowered following a couple of busted heists. Now, just because your mission objective is one particular item it doesn't mean you can't steal other stuff. Bigger devices such as microwave ovens or TVs can also be picked up and put in the trunk of your car. Be on the lookout for parking spaces as they allow you to change your clothes and also to sleep: sleeping is essential as if there are no or fewer tenants in a house your job will be significantly easier. Jack's ability to get better at running or have a bigger backpack all can improved in the form of skills. After each heist you get an evaluation and provided that you were not noticed and that you left with a full backpack you can get a very high score which can also yield you 50% plus XP.I completed the free Prologue and did not have the chance to use any lockpick tools. Also, there are some options in your inventory menu that are inactive. In the full game we'll probably be able to purchase real estate and also new vehicles.

If I'd dislike something about it, it would be the extra effects (filters) like VHS when I turned it off I felt it's way more clear to see and more beautiful in my opinion but good choice of filters to show the vibe of 80's.If I would recommend something for this game to add probably is the old clothes, old haircuts and the old style of a barber shop.

Similar to Thief Simulator, you find yourself at the mercy of individuals who hold your life in their hands and to get it back you must use your god given thieving talents to steal everything that isn't nailed down with leg warmers.THE GOOD:+ It's Thief Simulator - if you enjoy stalking, snatching and running for your life when it all goes wrong, this is for you.+ Small mini-games when using your tools to unlock, break or jimmy things open.+ The 1980s! See marvelous artifacts in history such as the cassette tapes, the VCR, the WALKMAN, and the CRT Television.  Don't let their arcane appearance fool you! Steal that ♥♥♥♥!+ The demo offered a single neighborhood that had a few places to revisit and plunder.  Additionally, with the bar contacts you're able to pick up a couple of sub quests that help you along your thieving path.THE BAD- Remember, it's an indie title. If you're looking for Red Dead Redemption 2 level interaction, you need to look elsewhere. This is a simple concept of scope, sneak, steal, slide on outta there. Even beyond the demo, it's very unlikely it'll reach that level simply due to budget and development team.   Approach with that in mind and you're good. - the AI seems more tolerant than the one found in Thief Simulator.  I understand that the change in attire will make me very difficult to spot, but if I sneak pass a resident within arms length and they become alerted it probably shouldn't take me moving behind a crate to immediately put them at ease.- Possibly just due to it being a demo: The NPCs in the area are pretty much mindless dolls that walk around and don't quite react to you the way actual people would.  They will react if they see you wearing clothing suitable for stealing things, or if you're rockin' that magnavox across the street to your junker of a car, but if you block them they simply stare into your wretched soul and wait for you to move off their pathing. THE UGLY~ Visually superior to Thief Simulator - but its pretty hard to see with the bloom up as high as they have it.  Everything glows and/or has this very surreal look.  It's not a deal breaker for me, but toning it down somewhat may allow the textures to really shine through.

It's expected that Playway SA games are going to be janky and rough around the edges, but this is extremely rough in a way that feels borderline unplayable to me. The graphics and models are bad and feel like a hodgepodge of pre-created assets that have been bought from the Unity Asset Store and inserted into the game. It doesn't feel coherent in any way.Aliasing is terrible even at 4k resolution with AA turned on, which is not acceptable in 2022. Settings don't save when you quit the game. Other issues like this throughout the game. So many rough edges.Merely moving forward feels clunky in first person with an extremely jarring and awkward view bob. Interacting with anything feels equally as bad and janky. Doors are just flaps that move back and forth when you walk into them. Why? It feels terrible. Everything I did in my limited playtime felt BAD. Everything.For a game that relies on stealth (and therefore fine control of your positioning and feedback from the environment), this level of jank and lack of control is a total deal-breaker. It feels clumsier in every way than Thief Simulator, and I felt that Thief Simulator was just barely tolerable as it was, with its many issues with being spotted through walls and other frustrating gameplay quirks.Maybe some of this will be ironed out by release, but any intention I had of purchasing the game has gone up in smoke with the poor state of this demo."}, {"username": "Plexy", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Pretty cool game.

All of the fine details have been polished somewhat.The graphics are a lot better too, but that was never what made the original game feel good.They've managed to keep that addictive core of sneaking around people's houses and sticky-fingering lots of little valuables, and I'm glad they haven't lost the core of their enjoyment. But if they can't fix basic movement issues from the first game, I'm not going to spend money to buy the same problems a 2nd time.I appreciate that they made a demo available, however. Tempted to buy this when it comes out just to encourage that practice. It takes balls to put out what you have for free before you have people's money in your grip."}, {"username": "KayJay", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Woof, where to start... This game needs a LOT of work still.  Animations feel incredibly bad, NPCs seem oblivious, and overall it just feels far worse to play than Thief Simulator.  Voice acting is... very rough, visually it looks like a game from the mid 2000s, and while I appreciate some of the gameplay changes, it just doesn't feel good to play.I think they nailed the aesthetic they were going for, but if this is an accurate preview to the game itself, it still needs a year+ in the oven still.EDIT: Biggest thing I forgot to mention that the devs NEED to address: Doors.  The doors SHOULD NOT operate just by walking through them.  Being able to actually open/shut doors is a pretty important aspect of stealth games.  Not being able to see through a doorway unless you're physically pushing the door open is such a monumentally bad change from Thief Simulator."}]}, {"game_id": "1254130", "game_title": "Phobies", "overall_score": "- 83% of the 129 user reviews in the last 30 days are positive.", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Dark Humor", "Horror", "Tactical", "Turn-Based Strategy", "Card Game", "Strategy", "Trading Card Game", "PvP", "Indie", "Turn-Based Tactics", "Creature Collector", "Puzzle", "Asynchronous Multiplayer", "2D", "Isometric", "Multiplayer", "Top-Down", "Colorful", "Stylized", "Cinematic"], "reviews": [{"username": "3P.Bunny", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Please  don’t let this one fall to corporate greed Pros-great visual design, music and soundwork-solid gameplay-asynchronous gameplay as well as ‘real time’-option to run multiple matches simultaneously-challenges are great to lead players on to realize important gameplay mechanics-free to playCons-mobile game ui-unlocks, daily missions – the usual free competitive online game suite-concerns about pay2win at higher ranks-you can poke others to take their turn but still you can be stuck for 3 days waiting Polish needed -‘Quit’ button on menu screen, scroll bar next to lists-more rock-paper-scissors synergy between the types of monstersI really enjoy this title.

The games art is awesome, the battles change every game, and the fear creatures are very unique. The game at first sight might look simple but it actually gets more complex as you play. Its also nice that this game is very free to play but it of course as all games do has a pay to win aspect. You can also play with friends and play 10 games at once and come back to them whenever you want which makes it really easy to play on your own time. If your looking for a strategy card game I would say this is one of the best ones out there and I have played A LOT. Overall this game definitely deserves a 9/10.Updated (I wanted to update my review on the game after 30 hours of game play)PROS:1.The game is very polished but could use some additions (noted below)2.The rewards received from jacks (reward system) and quests are scaled nicely3.Allows players to play against friends and even complete quests in friend battles (great feature)4.Allows for asynchronous playing and live play (each player in live seems to get a minute per turn)5. Art/animations/music is great6.The game is very intricate and new from any other game I've seenCONS:1.Game can seem pay to win if your cards are vastly under leveled. (But its understandable when a company needs to make money somehow, this aspect should be expected in virtually every game)2.In the live matches (arena mode) when you click your unit (fear) to move to a hex if the time runs out it stops where they are and doesn't continue the motion. (not sure if this is a bug or just a problem I found personally)3.There is a cap on resources (tears and experience) if you continue playing. (resets daily)4.The progression for obtaining coffee is to low, there should be ways to get more of it (maybe clan battles mentioned below)5.Some cards definitely seem way more utilized than others making other cards rarely if not never used.6.When you obtain to many cards there is no deck feature to remove unnecessary scrolling in battleADDITIONS:-Game needs a clan system of some sort with donations, clan wars, friendly battles, chat, etc.-Game needs emotes in both the asynchronous and especially the arena mode. (For asynchronous it could be to send out one emote per turn)-Game needs either a monthly or weekly tournament that players can enter for rewards-The game DEFINITELY needs a daily log in reward system to keep players coming back-Game NEEDS to uncap resources (tears and experience) even at a lesser amount is fine, but when a player keeps playing and there is no rewards beside coffee (resource) it feels very unrewarding. -There should be 2 re-rolls for quests daily instead of oneMy Thoughts:This game is one of the few games that doesn't have a battle pass and I applaud them for it. If they do include this aspect they should definitely keep it free. I think this game is fantastic and definitely needs some more attention from some of the big streamers to make it really shine. It has all the aspects to be a great game, but without all the additions I have mentioned this game will surely lose interest. If I could say this game was like anything else its like a mash up of Clash Royale, Legends of Runeterra, and Team Fight Tactics (of course there are other games but these are the ones that come to the top of the list for me). So after more hours under my belt i'm going to give this game a 8.2/10 because it has a huge room for improvement and if those additions are made it will no doubt become a 10/10."}, {"username": "ctbrow", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "After playing for nearly 30 hours, I can't recommend this game for two reasons. The first is that the rate of getting new characters is so slow (I got about one every 10 hours, 2 common and 1 uncommon), that this model quickly veers into pay to win. Playing with the basic characters is fine to start, but quickly becomes repetitive. The second issue is the lack of a player base. After playing in the arena for two days, I was already in the top 250 in the world. This led to longer and longer wait times to play anything except asychronous games. It is also sometimes frustrating with the few daily quests as some are nearly impossible when playing against other non-paying players.

I immediately started a new campaign. I know that’s a normal thing for a lot of people, but I’m very much a one-and-done gamer; usually when I beat a game, I’m fully satisfied to move on to something new. But not this time. Six hours in this game’s serene, storybook kingdoms simply wasn’t enough for me. I had to have more, had to build out a new flying city, and unite the world all over again. That’s what you want from the best building sims, that feeling that you cannot let go of the experience, and that is absolutely what is present here.Long ago, a legendary kingdom in the sky traveled the world, imparting knowledge and aid to the many kingdoms of the land. Their efforts brought peace and prosperity to all, until they vanished. In the intervening years, kingdoms fell upon hard times, and retreated into isolationism. The golden age of the world ended, but now you have the chance to bring it all back. The original airborne kingdom left behind plans for a new flying city, and you are to command this reborn hope for the world. Striking out from the arid deserts, you must grow your aerial burg, locate the twelve scattered kingdoms, and bring them together in some semblance of the peace and prosperity they enjoyed so long ago. Only then, will you learn of the fate that befell those who traveled the skies before you.Setting aside the absolutely fantastical optimism of a technologically-advanced society that DIDN’T use their powers for conquest, this is a marvelous premise for a game and fits extremely well with the serene atmosphere of the gameplay. Starting out, you have only the main building of your flying city. From there, you build paths, housing, workshops, and warehouses as you would with most resource-based builders. But given the unique nature of the game, you also have to place hangars for gatherers to launch expeditions from, mechanisms like wings and turbines to keep the city afloat, and different engines to help move the city across the world. Your chief concerns are food, water, and coal, and while you get options to use or process them more efficiently, you’ll always need to be replenishing your supply from the surface. Beyond that, you’ll need an assortment of other resources like wood, clay, and quartz to build your burg out. Some are renewable, some aren’t, but sourcing all of them will factor heavily into where you city goes and how it gets there.Another key concern that really spices up the building is the tilt of your city. Not only do you need to generate enough lift to stay airborne, you need to balance it out so your citizens aren’t living their lives at a permanent Dutch angle. Your options for balancing tilt are wide open, too, because you can try to build things symmetrically, or you can cluster all your thrusters at one end and all your buildings on the other like some kind of mortal see-saw, or you can try all sorts of other configurations. Your population will have new demands as it grows as well (as new citizens can be recruited from terrestrial towns), including lit roads, sources of faith, health care, and more. The mood of your city determines how easy it is to recruit new folks, and you can research all kinds of buildings that mix and match satisfaction of different needs, like tea houses and spirit healers. You’ll need to research all your new toys for your town, after buying the tech from the old kingdoms using relics found in ruins dotted around the map.I think this might be my favorite aspect of Airborne Kingdom, how smartly all of its systems are interconnected. Exploring the map is hugely important, since that’s how you’ll find the kingdoms you need to unite. But you’ll also find towns to expand your population, ruins that provide relics to trade for tech, secrets that allow you access to powerful wonders, and even workshops that give you new color customization options for your city. Certain regions have unique resources or, more importantly, lack certain staples like food or coal, so getting your kingdom ready for tougher journeys is part of the progression as well. It’s immensely satisfying to start out with a tiny, barely-functional village struggling with lift and stocking necessities, and eventually build up to a flying juggernaut that can survive comfortably for days without gathering expeditions.Each kingdom you meet will have a main quest for you to complete to earn their trust, usually a simple task like building them a structure or locating a nearby ruin. Further-flung kingdoms have more complicated requests, but none of them are particularly taxing. Between the quests and exploring, there’s enough to do to keep you busy as you tool across the skies and build out your own kingdom. It took me about six hours to reach the ending, and then I immediately jumped into the New Game + mode which randomizes the map and offers you new city centers to choose from. There’s also Normal and Hard difficulties for any new game, though I didn’t notice a huge difference between them. Either way, you’ll have plenty of ways to enjoy this gorgeous, storybook builder as you explore and expand. I’ve gotten pickier about builders in my old age, and Airborne Kingdom absolutely hits the sweet spot for me of interesting systems and relaxing development.Did you enjoy this review?

The city building is fun and intuitive (which is a lot to ask, it seems, of modern city builders), I like tooling around and gathering resources, doing little quests for the locals. It's lacking in QoL features though. I'd like to be able to selectively assign workers to jobs -- pulling workers off propulsion to go gather resources, etc, waypoints on the map would be nice, as would a 'always drive forward' / heading-and-speed navigation mode (I found myself figuring out a bearing and then clicking way off in the distance, which worked but was kinda clunky, it'd be nice to just pick a heading and set speed). I'd like to see more complexity, a bigger world, more options for how to approach the game (maybe I want to be a scavenger ship, maybe a self-sustained green paradise, maybe a pirate ship). Combat would be a welcome addition, although I don't think it's strictly necessary.Overall it's good and I look forward to updates."}, {"username": "sebb628", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "There is nothing like it.

To keep away from spoilers, I’ll only say that the story can at times feel a bit fragmented and a bit forced, but it’s clear that the authors have something both important and heartfelt to convey.  I expect most people will find something both familiar and meaningful in the story and characters of Siren’s Call.The game will probably take most people 7-10 hours to finish, though reaching 100% completion may add on an hour or so.  The sprite work is generally decent though can sometimes dip in quality, but the feel of the game sprites, backgrounds, and music are fitting for the story's setting and mood and work well together.

Also the graphics are insanely beautiful as if they were painted on a canvas. The psycho-horror aspect in this game should also not be disregarded as it might literally throw you for a loop once in a while. You can really tell, that a lot of work has been put into this.As a beta-tester I played this game before it's official release. When reporting bugs or glitches, the developer was super kind. He took notes of them or fixed them directly and even told me, why and how these appeared. They are a very nice person to interact with and don't want to put walls around themselves like other bigger developers often do. Chatiting with them was also a very pleasurable experience.The only things I would have wanted different is that the game itself is longer and contains more psycho-horror. Other than that I have nothing to complain about.All in all is Siren's Call a very nice experience to have. If it had cost me money, I would have paid full price. Because I missed some collectible stuff while playing, I'm definetly gonna come back to this game soon to play it until I have seen 100% of it.

Clocking in under 10 hours it is also on the shorter side for the genre. It effectively uses that time to tell a compelling coming of age story. The characters are well written and likable, the visuals good, and the story wraps up in an exceptionally satisfying manner that I will not spoil. The visual novel also always manages to maintain great atmosphere, dancing between creepy and comfy with no disconnect. I highly recommend this VN. Especially to fans of DDLC and Katawa Shoujo.PS the waifus are cute."}, {"username": "Raki8000", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Disclaimer:  I have played this game on a prerelease copy, so some issues, especially on the technical side of things, might have been fixed.English visual novels tend to have a reputation of being low quality, copies of already existing Japanese VNs, riding on the success of Doki Doki Literature Club, or just straight up porn. Thankfully, Siren's Call is an ambitious release and a breath of fresh air for the OELVN community, despite one's possible initial fear of seeing an indie English VN.Siren's call handles the \"psychological\" part of \"psychological horror\" very well, dealing with real world mental disorders in a frightening, yet respectful way. Quite a bit of time is spent on making you understand the struggles of people having to deal with mental ilnesses, so you can also learn quite a bit about this subject from reading this.The first hour or so might seem confusing at first, keep in mind that it is the type of story where you are given more and more pieces to its central mystery, and by the end most things will be solved, so stick with it until the end if you think nothing makes sense, as this is intentional. That being said, there is quite a bit of technical jank, most likely stemming from the engine, that might get annoying, and will make you aware of the fact that this is indeed an indie release.  Pros:  Interesting story, will keep you guessing what will happen next, and is well paced. Great central mystery with a lot of foreshadowing and hints that will keep the keen eyed reader on their toes. Well done and respectful depictions of mental disorders, will make you learn quite a bit about several of them. Beautiful graphics, backgrounds are extremely gorgeous with their painting style, characters have a wide range of expressions and sprites, and the surprising amount of animations gives them a lot of life. Ok soundtrack that, while not incredibly memorable, succeeds in setting the tone of every scene. Surprisingly, for a visual novel, it has a lot of unlockables in the in-game gallery, rewarding players for taking unusual paths through the story. (minor spoiler) Makes great use of the visual novel format, with clever changes of the UI, and the choice system.  Cons:  Quite a lot of technical issues that are noticeable and very annoying, like saving crashing the game, opening the options menu resetting the resolution to its default, and the \"skip unread text\" option not working. The choice structure allows you to skip quite a lot of important scenes on the first playthrough. This made a few scenes that were supposed to have a lot of impact fall flat. One egregious example is (ambiguously worded, but fairly major spoiler nonetheless) near the end of the game where the text clearly expects you to have gone through a loop of that particular chapter for a few times, but if you choose the right option during the first loop the text doesn't change to accommodate this and the impact of the scene is partly lost.  A few of the horror scenes seem to rely a bit too much on the shock factor, as they loosely fit into the wider story. (minor spoiler)  Many of the meta scenes are never mentioned again and don't seem to serve as foreshadowing for anything, and the first Velvet scene especially just seems like a DDLC type of meta-scare that is there only to frighten the player.  Very out of place scene near the end of the game with mature content that is not mentioned in the mature content description, for some reason. (ambiguously worded minor spoiler) Two scenes in the last chapter have CGs that depict some minor gore, including slight body horror, blood and a maggot. No other scene I've stumbled upon had any kind of gore in it, so this was very unexpected. Overall a very interesting experience and a great example of what the OELVN community can do.Btw, Judith best girl."}, {"username": "Xanedon", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "First off, I really enjoyed reading through this!Pros:This is a very story driven VN, and while there are choices you make throughout the game, don't be confused when it seems like you are back where you started! You will make progress, but sometimes you have to watch for the clues in the other conversations on how to proceed. All in all super enjoyable.Cons:There is a lot of backstory that may be confusing at first.  They reference events that you as the reader really don't know anything about, HOWEVER, a lot of that story is unlocked in the in game journal, and as it so happens, merely serves as a backdrop to something else which I will not go into to avoid spoilers. It's not a big con, but I know some people might be confused about it starting off.After the first play-through I definitely did a 2nd one with more knowledge about what was going on and it really added spice to the story and made the dialog make even more sense.

There aren't many visual novels that make me wake up earlier to play before work. Getting to play this game a week early was supposed to allow me to be able to fully enjoy it but sadly life caught up to me this whole week. As of me writing this review, I am at 72% done and it has been a game I feel as though I need to give all of my attention to.My first impressions of the characters were not the greatest but that changed instantly. I felt as though I genuinely got to get close to each of them. The dialogue was confusing at first until I realized that the in game mechanic of having the journal was truly necessary.This is one of 2 visual novels that I have been able to talk about with my coworkers( who are close friends) while we work and the delved right into the world together with me. They absolutely hate having any sort of conversations with me about them but for the past week, whatever little bit more I read, they had to know what was going on. I never would have thought that I would be able to have discussions or be able to theory craft with them over this.I don't know how else to describe this game other than the fact that it was great and am genuinely planning on buying merchandise because I want to support the creators in any way I can. Only other thing I can say is that might change your consideration into the game's favor for you to give it a chance is that this is maybe like my second or third ever review on a game and it is the longest one I have made by a landslide.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"}]}, {"game_id": "1949380", "game_title": "Capture_Creatures", "overall_score": null, "best_score": null, "worst_score": null, "tags": ["Card Battler", "Trading Card Game", "Turn-Based Tactics", "Creature Collector", "PvP", "Card Game", "Strategy RPG", "RPG", "Turn-Based Strategy", "Strategy", "JRPG", "2D", "Top-Down", "LGBTQ+", "Deckbuilding", "Casual", "Turn-Based Combat", "Pixel Graphics", "Family Friendly", "Indie"], "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1946990", "game_title": "Astrocat_Milky_Way_Journey", "overall_score": "- Need more user reviews to generate a score", "best_score": "10", "worst_score": "1", "tags": ["Cats", "Casual", "Puzzle", "Cute", "Relaxing", "Space", "Hand-drawn", "Family Friendly", "Atmospheric", "Indie", "Colorful", "Stylized", "Minimalist", "Education", "2D", "Singleplayer", "Logic", "Mouse only"], "reviews": [{"username": "Lord Baphomet", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I hope Skylar comes back to earth and show all hers photos to the flat-earthers.

Making the drinks is surprisingly entertaining although that's not what makes The Closing Shift so great.The ordinariness of the situation - a girl working the closing shift at a coffee shop - grounds the story in reality and makes for a truly eerie experience. The game plays on very real fears (the dark, stalkers, and being alone to name a few) to create an uneasy atmosphere, building up the horror rather than simply relying on cheap jumpscares.Graphics and Atmosphere: 4/5The graphics are excellent and the game has a striking 90s/VHS aesthetic which complements the tone of the game well. The Closing Shift's atmosphere is dark and moody although doesn't shy away from moments of comedy, which I found to be a welcome inclusion in the narrative.The character models and, particularly the walking, animations are janky but I find it adds to the unsettling vibe of the game rather than detracts from it. There's something uncanny about that way the customers look at you, which reflects well the unease of having people's gaze on you knowing they could be your stalker.Performance: 4/5The game runs smoothly and I only encountered one bug whereby a piece of the environment didn't appear properly (although this was fixed with a quick restart).Recommendation: Definitely worth full price!"}, {"username": "DeadeGuard98", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Curator page here--> DaRevieweD #172 <-- New review every Weekend”OH TO COME APRON A CREEP!!\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783654216 Here's The Thing:You are a girl barista at Chilla’s Café working night shifts and sometimes in charge of closing for the day! Business is as usual; a few packed orders, some lone customers to make chit chat with and the occasional oddballs. Yet she can’t help but feel even more spied on by one same patron every day making an appearance here and there… Inching closer by the weeks~[+] PROS;:)  THANK YOU, NEXT~Let it be made known that yes, this latest title by Chilla’s Art (CA) is by far the closest to their trademark hit  The Convenience Store. For instance, the manning of a store- or should I say wo-manning? Miscellaneous tasks, journey to the workplace and the panic-inducing orchestration of some scares. They even share the same initials “TCS” for god sake. Coincidence, I think not!The biggest and newest feature is actually the barista simulation of packing pastries, brewing beverages according to their recipes- which you can then make your own at home? SWEET! Luckily customers are very patient and polite, to your face that is, having witnessed you go in and out the staff room to refer to your cheat sheet. There were some choices, not a first for the franchise; but to be worked in the dialogue and belonging quite well was a treat!Took me nearly three hours before resigning, with- I think and please don’t quote me on this- just a single ending? But those with past Starbucks and or other coffee establishment experience may finish it in two hours tops~TIPS:1) The orders are the same, so you can prepare them in advance should you have to restart a day!2) Can’t get the order right? It’s actually all in “the order”.3) Drink or pastry ready-to-go? Just slap the order sticker from anywhere!:)  KEEP CHILLED WHILE CHILLING AT WORK!A CA game where I didn’t want to constantly piss my pants? Instead, I get a lounge and jazz ensemble like I was also a carefree patron of the café!? But alas- or should I say thank goodness for there are two sides to the business. With the other stabbing fright and looming paranoia set in after hours so it’s a hefty balance! The café interior classes things up, kicks butt and now I really want to be a coffee freak, freeloader of wi-fi person. Patrons-wise, there are some model-quality, super kawaii acts but overall, I dig the diverse faces in the crowd. Until you realize that also means more to go through in the event of having to pick one from a line-up~:)  SHIFT. HAPPENS. I’m sure it’s fairly obvious by now that I have difficulty talking about The Closing Shift without constantly referencing The Convenience Store… But I’ll try anyway; a tragic, “unrequited” love story and one of growing obsession. It utterly milks this plot line for everything it’s got, tosses in a café to entertain and totally NOT to distract you from what happens when your attention is directed elsewhere in pleasing customers.But yes, if I had to bring in an analogy- it is P2 (2007) coming in for the kill on The Convenience Store (2020). Can’t believe it’s only been about two years for the latter…! Good times!! While there isn’t much in the characterization of the protagonist, we can still infer as to why she’s working there. And it is certainly not to be targeted. The only thing that remains a mystery is the perpetrator’s motives~:)  JACK THE BEAN-STALKER…The horror isn’t as underlying or immaterial as The Convenience Store where every shopper had that air of death or at least having faced it. Here, there is a face attached and at times, multiple ones… But only because over time of memorizing recipes and having your back turned- you sort of “forget” how they look. It doesn’t help that there are patrons who also hit on you and demand your number! Or catching mere fragments of the customers talking aloud about being leered at while on a bus journey.The answer is blatantly palpable until it physically hurts. And it shifts into a matter of waiting for them to act! The wait is insufferable, and meanwhile you jump at every noise near your apartment complex. You focus on the patrons, more than is deemed healthy! I tell you, as someone who’s worked in a café before and never worried about it, because thankfully it didn’t open too late. Now it will be all that’s on my mind so thanks a lot CA for ruining yet another profession. I’m kidding… sort of, as it’s more to raise awareness on the issue~https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783656527[-] CONS;:(  JUST DOESN’T REGISTER?The whipping up of beverage portion is wholesome and fun to get into. But there were some glaring gameplay issues with it. For instance, inserting an empty blender jug will have it perform its grind animation even with nothing in it. Some workstations, like when drinks are on the coffee dispenser- they cannot be used for mixing ingredients and instead have to be relocated to another place mat. It sounds very petty and I realize it as I’m typing but it’s enough to make anyone snap~:(  A SLOPPY EMPLOYEE…The huge difference between this and previous titles is its predictability, which is even more visible than usual! For one thing, if you played The Convenience Store- you’ll see a lot of similarities already which do ruin things in terms of expectations. And another it’s turned into more of a series of slasher tropes which would be fine in games like those by Puppet Combo~:( TOO MUCH INGREDIENTS!The story and direction are not exempted from this! In that they stray from the reputable formula of oozing paranormal behind the everyday occurrences… But here, not once did I think it had any other explanation apart from the obvious and mortal danger~BUGS:x Cars have no drivers!x Can go into/crash into/hitch a ride in cars.x Car asset missing and then suddenly reappearing. Could be intentional?x One customer stuck in the same looped animation and as conversation wasn’t even done. No order ticket was produced.x Some models had bizarrely fast walking speeds and appeared stiff-jointed!x Drinks can be stacked together at the collection area.x TV footage apparently don’t change until you “look closer”.NITPICKS:~ Cannot simply return to main menu without having to quit first.~ Can put back some items and not others.~ Beverage making is hard enough with the cups being empty. At least have the labels for what’s already in them! Besides the inventory…~ Cups to be disposed don’t correlate to orders prior to start of shift.~ Tutorial tapes play on a very small screen and is in Japanese regardless of language chosen.~ One dialogue choice left untranslated.\"- THIS IS THE LAST STRAW…!\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783657446Last Words?Latest CA entry is a misnomer in the franchise. Been done in The Convenience Store only now with more drinks… With a threat that’s always known. Still strange but I do fret as to what’s next~ If you like The Convenience Store and are finding a reason to NOT work late nights. If you love The Convenience Store but want a less scary, more chill version. Even as the series’ black sheep- it still offers a great deal.

At this point in time the game is NOT worth 10$...It is not finished. The UI is a mess, filled with info that is very unrelated to what you are doing. The sensitivity finder - which is the whole selling point - is very very messy. I input my current sens and lets say its 1 for this example. It will put a range that is super high like 5x higher than what you play. And then you play scenarios that you cannot even aim at because you move your mouse half and inch and you do a 360... Look if all you need is a sense finder, just play some free aim trainer and try out different sens and look at your stats, that way you can control by how much you are going up or down the scale. Because this is making me worse at aiming rather than better... You forget your muscle memory when it jumps you 5x higher than your usual sens...Overall i do not recommend at this point in time. The dev team seems super chill and nice but the game is just not ready and not worth 10$ in my opinion. It has very very very few scenarios which is understandable since its new but they should have waited longer or hired more people to have a bigger library. NEGATIVES:  - Settings page is very confusing - Landing page is a mess - Sens finder is a big miss atleast in my case - Very choppy on some scenarios with fps dropping randomly - The fact that you have to convert to their sens is a bit annoying as well. Just let me select a game and show me that sens so i can understand how much up and down you taking my sens...

From the poor, emotionless UI to the laggy frame drops and freezes. The boring text, and the spelling mistakes within them.However, the reason I'm not refunding and still plan on using Oblivity is because when you look at the positive sides of things, it's a pretty good product. Oblivity is the perfect tool to help you learn your perfect sensitivity, only an hour after game-play I genuinely feel like my precision in Valorant has increased significantly because of Oblivity, and I'm excited to see the updates and changes that will improve our experience playing Oblivity.A list of thoughts / bugs I noticed:- The UI could have more visual and auditory feedback.- Music- Text has basic font- Text too small at times- Too much text on screen at times- Text overlaps other text at times (specifically when selecting a training mode)- Frame drops when loading/resetting training mode- Sometimes not clear how to go back to the previous page- Video that plays cuts off near the end before finishing the videoI'm going to recommend this game because I do believe it can be one of the best aim trainers out there.Well done Poly Games! :D"}, {"username": "Handi", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Oblivity is totaly not ready yet... looks like they spent more time making tiktoks than actualy perfecting the software... btw aimlabs is free and looks way better. Stop making ads about it and focus on the software itself"}, {"username": "Tinky Winky", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "So I have spent some time in the game playing around and trying out everything I could find. Here is my summary. Lets start with the GOOD first:  As someone who loves statistics, Oblivity is amazing. It has everything you can think about and probably more. Even though it has not been out long enough to tell if the sensitivity finder works well, it seems to do what it says. The fact that they do not \"rush\" your ideal sensitivity and force you to get a X amount of data-points is a good sign. Visually, I really like it. Both UI (visually!) and training look great and I prefer it over other aim trainers for sure. The fact that you can change everything from the sound of all the actions possible to uploading a fully custom         crosshair is amazing. Even though it is overwhelming (see the bads for more info) it is still very easy to use and you get used to it quickly. It might be more difficult if you aren't that familiar with complicated statistical interfaces but it is manageable. The replay system is honestly a cherry on top. The fact you can see everything in there, even the optimal path between targets and the path YOU took is such an underrated feature. I instantly noticed a weird flick I do when going to targets on the left but not on the right. After spotting this, I practice some more and now it is way less frequent and it's getting better and better! There is NO loading time between main menu and training!! Very good thing is that they include tutorials and even video instructions when accessing things for the first time. Please don't skip these as they make the UI and the trainer way less confusing! And then the bad:  The primary point, which most of the bad reviews mention, is the UI. While I think they did a decent job in implementing what they have, I understand that the UI feels very busy and messy. Fact is, you can not implement an UI like aimlabs if you want the amount of information that they provide. I am sure they will be working on this and optimize it if the trainer does well but for now, it might be very overwhelming for the \"casuals\". I have seen some complaints about performance, while I have not experienced it myself I am still mentioning it here. Some people experience slight stutters and freezes from time to time. This one is fixable with some settings but, I don't like the initial in game UI. Having \"weapon\" stats at the bottom, a minimap and text that appears when you kill something is just so not needed. You CAN turn these off but I think these should be off by default and there should be a prompt stating you can adjust your UI. Conclusion: Overall I think the trainer is worth the 8 euros. Sure, aimlab might be free but it does NOT offer the same service as Oblivity. If they fix the current performance issues and optimize the UI, this trainer will be the best trainer currently available for people that are interested in more than the general \"Give me target, I shoot, I am better now\". Anyone saying that the trainer is not worth any money or is total garbage just does not have the brain capacity to use the statistical information that Oblivity provides."}, {"username": "disapproved", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I highly recommend this program, a lot of people were saying that the sensitivity finder wasn't working well, which is what i thought when i first used it, it gave me the same sens i was using before, but you need to play it a lot so that oblivity gets more data so it gives you more accurate results, I also saw people saying that the sensitivity that its putting them on was way too high/low, this is because when starting a new profile and then where it says to track your mouse pad, do not track all of the surface area, you need to only track where you aim mostly, and you also must put in your previous mouse sensitivity so it can get a better understanding of your aiming style. I think the program could be a little more user friendly as it is extremely confusing when you first use it, but once you get the hang of it its excellent, been using it for 3 days now and its already improved my accuracy, and i am noticing the difference. Most people who said the sens finder was bad aren't actually using it correctly, and what people gotta realise its an early access trainer and it will not be perfect when it first releases. I think that this is the perfect program to use if you struggle in aiming, but you have to know how to use it correctly to get the most accurate results."}, {"username": "yikes", "score": "Not Recommended", "comment": "Couple of hours in and honestly this doesn't do anything that Aimlab or KovaaK don't do much better.

And that in time, I can come back and make this my main aim-trainer! I think the concept is there, but it needs work. It's early access and released this year, so it's all right. It's not filled with many bugs so I'll let it slide, but \"early access\" is becoming a bad excuse in most game releases these days.I think for right now, I can't really recommend this product just yet. But I do see in the future if changes happen. I will keep a close eye on this trainer!Pros: Fair pricing (AimBeast's recent price increase was stupid) $10 is perfect pricing, and no paid DLCs Replay viewer is one of my favorite features, and I wish other aim trainers implemented it. UI designer is clean and modern The statistics and graphs are awesome! But I could see it overwhelming for beginners! Have a simplistic and advanced view, or grouping it maybe in the future? Good amount of options in there. Not too complicated for a beginner; advanced for the more experienced.  Sensitivity Randomizer More technical terms like cm / 360 Seems to listen to their community Nice tutorial in the beginning, so you aren't completely lost Custom scenarios, easy to make.Cons:The priority of \"perfect sensitivity\" makes it hard for me to recommend. Though I understand it's per game, with having added a sensitivity randomizer. It's under the concept that you don't need to stick to one sensitivity over all your games. That different sensitivities suit better specific games/game types. WHICH IS GOOD, but I could find those ranges in a Google Doc by other aim communities in 2 minutes, then needing to run 10 minutes of scenarios. (Cool concept though. I guess for non-experienced aim trainer users, it's great!) Some other stuff isn't intuitive, like local to find your scenarios, while the online tab only shows routines.  FOV type / Game terms are their technical versions, and most people who aren't from AimBeast or Kovaaks will understand. (HDeg & VDeg) Scrolling through the playlist and scenarios list, it randomly goes back up. And I know it's not my mouse and a dirty scroll wheel encoder. No clock UI setting. Some aim communities use a clock for their community ranks systems to ensure no cheating happens. Those with one monitor (I have two) need to tab to check the time. Just allow a toggle, then we are good! Closest Mouse Path seems based on your last target kill. Not your current mouse position. I don't know how it would affect game performance to have it run calculations constantly. So I'll let it slide. Most people will have this off, as you usually look ahead to your next target for static scenarios. You also go for clusters instead of closest for higher scores so... Why have a tips section when it's just listed as \"Coming soon\"? AimBeast has \"Arena\" and \"Routine\" sections for an entire year as \"Coming Soon\" and still waiting for the \"Arena\" The \"Sensitivity\" overlay for in-game, only shows Oblivity sensitivity. Most people will be in a specific game profile and not \"Oblivity\" as their sensitivity profile. Either show whatever game profile you are in, or cm / 360. Or get used to having people have it disabled. The game likes to randomly stutter for me while running scenarios, which is annoying. I don't mind if the game lags when doing score calculations like in Kovaaks or AimLab, but in actual scenario runs, it is painful. Most people don't play aim trainers for the trainer. They are used more like a warm-up, but it still discourages me from using the trainer. People for leaderboards, scores, and competitions will look at other competitors. More games in the \"converter\" tab would be something for the future. Other aim trainers like Kovaaks and AimBeast don't list many games. But you are also competing with AimLab's list, which is free. Being able to input cm / 360 directly would also be nice :D While the UI is modern and clean, it's overwhelming for beginners. It's what drives people away from Kovaaks and AimLab at times. The AimLab scenarios (Sixshot, Gridshot, etc) are just a personal gripe of mine. But I've come to hate it, and felt low effort, lazy, and do the opposite of making your aim better. When you have advanced scenarios by community members in other trainers, it makes the basic ones feel awful.I wish the developers and the rest of the staff the best of luck, and I hope to see the trainer grow."}, {"username": "itsnickk", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "It's kind of confusing to use at first, but once I got the hang of it, I've really liked it.

The truth is these games have been re-released also previously on GOG a few years back. Same exact games. The ones on Steam are no different in terms of the way they look and play. The one major thing the Steam versions have going for them however which would make a good choice for people who are wondering which versions to get are that the Steam ones are more streamlined in overall presentation. The games on GOG come as separate entries in your library. Things such as manuals, guidebooks, codebooks and other content are all downloaded manually on GOG. Some items even have to be extracted after being downloaded as they download in zip files. And then it would be a little cumbersome to search for the necessary documents when you need them each time. What GOG does have going for it though is that they are 100% DRM free titles. Now where Steam shines as mentioned before is how streamlined they are with these games. You get a unified launcher for the gold box games. any games you own in the series will show up in the launcher. so you could launch say Archives Collection One and play Pool of Radiance instead, or maybe Al Qadim, as long as you own those also. Furthermore, documents, code wheels, and everything are accessible right in the launcher. no need to hunt them down. It's recommended to play in a windowed mode to have access to both the game and the launcher for your necessary resources, but the launcher has you covered with a variety of windowed resolutions to make things look nice. GOG on the flipside would require you you to manually go into dosbox to fiddle with these settings as the basic launch only gives you either fullscreen or a tiny window if you alt tab out. It can still work the way you want, but for those not looking to waste time setting things up and get right into the games, the Steam version has got you covered in the best way."}, {"username": "Neferex", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Well here we are, back at it again.

In each game of the Saga, you can transfer your characters from a previous game making it out to be one epic adventure. In addition to the Pools Saga, there are the 2 classics of the Savage Frontier. In Frontier games you will find the first time in the history of PC gaming NPCs that could interact with meaningfully, even the first time you could have a romance. The final game in this volume, Unlimited Adventures, is for those that really enjoy the game engine. It allows you to make your own games. The negative in all this is that the modern gamer will hate this game. I would never have got it myself if it did not come with an auto mapper and the app that made it more playable. The app allows you to access logs, journals, and hints if you need them. Back in the day, most of this took a lot of work and most of the time you did your own mapping. What remains a nightmare for me is the loot management. For instance, after each battle you must decide what to do with the loot, where it goes, who will take it, and all through a series of changing inventory screens. This is simply no fun and takes up a great deal of the game. The combat is also no fun and its pretty dull in terms of the modern turn-based games out there.

However in my opinion the game only gets better and better from there, all the way up to it’s triumphant finale. Some of the twists by the end of the game are strongly hinted at but still fun to experience, but one twist in particular I would never have seen coming in a million years.Both the story and puzzles are equally strong, but after reading some of the other reviews I think I personally thought more of the story and less of the puzzles.  Don't get me wrong, some of the more creative puzzles really got me, as the out-of-the-box, world manipulation style puzzles were very unique and really satisfying to solve.  I think the fact that they're genuinely creative compared to most games made me feel really smart when I figured it out myself.  However at the same time there are a decent amount of puzzles that aren't too different, mostly talking about the grey tile puzzles in Sky Mountain and the bouncing spring flowers in the beach area.However the story itself, and more specifically the characters is what really surprised me.  Like I said in my initial review, the story is a lot more emotional and moving than I expected, combined with the gorgeous music I was really immersed in the narrative.  My one gripe is that we don’t get to see enough of the characters, there are still some questions left unanswered as I’d want to know what happened in the past, specifically with Mischief & his dad and Superb Man & the prophet. But the main character’s arc is so strong that even knowing she would win in the end did not water down or diminish its power in the end. The last thing not necessarily related to the game itself- I think this is what I’m looking for in a cheap indie game like this. These types of hidden gems that aren’t just re-hashed ideas with a new coat of paint. This is a truly unique experience with a real soul, it honestly makes a tangible difference.  Sequel soon?(EDIT 2 - Also, some of the tracks are just fantastic, my personal favorites being the sacred prophecy room, violet caverns, final flower reveal, and even the title screen music among many others.  Even the hidden dev room has really catchy music)"}, {"username": "kampy", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Currently about 1 hour into the game and I am very much enjoying it.

Can't wait to meet more characters."}, {"username": "Shiara", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I bought this due to liking the demo during the last Steam Next Fest, and I quite enjoyed this full game. It's not super long, I clocked in a 100% clear in one blind playthrough that took 4.1 hours, and it was a pleasant four hours, punctuated with the occasional titular epiphany brought about by figuring out a puzzle's solution or at a plot twist or reveal in the story. I think the game is fairly priced at its full price. My thoughts on various parts of the game follow:- Story: It started off as a bit of a campy superhero story set in a mildly magical world, before tossing in a few plot twists. I thought that was perfectly fine and enjoyable though, just don't expect scientific reasons as to why things work the way they do or why animals talk. I appreciated the story and particularly adored the depiction of the main character and her struggles with depression, as well as her awesome best friend. I like descent into insanity arcs and the game flirted with that theme a tiny bit, which was a pleasant surprise. A few plot twists were also tried and I found them to be good. They weren't super obvious since I don't purposely try to guess at what's coming up, but they fit into the story so well. The start was a bit heavy (both in terms of narration/cutscene and in terms of setting up Lily's rather dark background) though, but they do acknowledge that. It tries to hit an emotional note but I don't think it really succeeds due to the length of the game. The ending was extremely satisfying, if a bit abrupt.- Puzzles: It has a lot of them, but by and large they aren't difficult since each puzzle is mostly self-contained within a room, except when you had to gather items from multiple rooms to one place to pass some barrier. The goal of each room was fairly clear, it was just the matter of how to do the thing you needed to do, rather than having to figure out how to even progress. There were exceptions though, with a couple rather obtuse rooms (the cake room, the last camera room, and a couple of the garden rooms being some examples where I didn't fully follow the logic even after solving them -- though this last one apparently might have been due to a launch-day bug in the end) but overall those were a very thin minority and I enjoyed the puzzles overall. I also liked how some of the mechanics were foreshadowed before they were actually used, though I think at least one early \"special mechanic\" (the water) was not used later on at all and I thought that was a bit of a shame. I would also have liked to see harder multi-room puzzles. But I felt that what was there worked and wasn't particularly tough at any point, but neither was it a cakewalk.- Charm: I loved the character and background art quite a bit, and some of the goofy exchanges between the characters and even enemies were pretty fun. The semi-hidden dev room made me happy, more games should have that. I apologize to the composer for not remembering any of the music, hehe. It complemented without standing out! That's a good thing!I don't have any major negatives about the game, and there weren't a ton of minor annoyances either, it was a short game. Some QoL stuff like a room reset button would have been nice, but no big deal really. I can see other people not liking the endgame portion where you have to basically play a reflexive rhythm game and some timed puzzles to progress though, but I didn't even see a hit point bar anywhere so I'm not sure if you could even lose those, at worst you probably just get a room reset and there are no achievements tied to having a perfect run, thankfully. There ARE (at least) two missable achievements though, and the key to not missing those is to not hurry through the game. There's no save feature for you to go back for those if you do so you have to replay it to get them as they're in the midgame. I think the demo version had a scene/puzzle jumper tool and that would have been nice in this full version as well."}, {"username": "Nick Damiano", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "I saw the game on reddit and figured \"let me give it a try.\" I am so glad I did.

Overall, there are some minor hiccups, (I got into an unsolvable state once) and certain things feel kind of weird (specifically running, the animation feels kind of weird) but the systems play very nicely and the story is great!

Is this game a masterpiece? This game looks like a Nintendo Gameboy release with 4 colors, but it uses a large screen. It also plays like a Gameboy classic - but this is not a bad thing. It's a run and gun game - jump and shoot (in 4 directions), avoid endless pits, other environemental dangers and enemies. Quite easy to understand, even for me. There are people to talk to, cutsequences to watch, weapons and other items to find - but simply shooting everything also works rather good (most of the time). Later in the game you have to use little vehicles, like a one-man submarine or a tiny mech. Furthermore, you don't play just one hero. You can switch between different characters with unique skills and weapons. The 4-color visuals look great (you unlock new color palettes to swap all the time) - but it does make dangers (or objects to pick up) sometimes hard to see. Save anytime and anywhere - but you have only one slot. My noname gamepad worked fine. So, is it a masterpiece? Probably not, but certainly a solid handiwork if you enjoy some retro action once in a while (like I do). Conclusion:Modern run'n gun in Gameboy visuals and with some exploring and backtracking required."}, {"username": "Sosich", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "A nostalgic trip down the new-age metroidvania.After completing the tutorial level, you will be brought to a base located above the underground complex. You can use this area to heal, test your skills in a training facility, acquire upgrades on the black market, and switch between characters. Everyone has the ability to jump, shoot, and cling to the wall. Wall jumping, which is required to unlock in practically every metroidvania, is available right away.The only thing that distinguishes the characters is their weapon and special ability, which are listed on their ID cards among other information like age and nationality. At first, only four squad members are available; the others are discovered as you explore the complex and after you finish the game. Despite differences in speed and power, the shooting pattern is what you should be looking at. Some have a slower gun that fires stronger bullets, while others have a quick machinegun that fires weaker bullets. It all comes down to personal preference. You'll generally stick with one hero to the end, with the exception of a portion when a certain hero is required and vehicle stages. Special ability also doesn’t matter; the game can be finished without ever using it.You can buy ammo for special weapons and permanent boosts like health in the various black markets scattered around the map. The game’s currency viridium is dropped by enemies. However, until you discover a larger container, you can only carry a limited amount of viridium. I don't think I enjoy the training facility very much because it requires a recharge after each use. I get that the viridium-filled chest at the end of a training task may make obtaining upgrades a breeze, but foes drop the valuable material at a steady rate anyway.The complex is separated into various areas, each with its own set of enemies and aesthetics. It’s also very limited in terms of exploration. There are no permanent upgrades or special powers in hidden regions of the map, save from black marketplaces, which offer every key item you will need.  This necessitates a careful exploration of the map for the larger containers, as key items cost several hundred viridium bits, which you won't be able to stash in your starting container.Saving takes place at designated locations across the complex. For rapid travel around the base, some sites may contain an elevator. There's also the option of saving the game without having to find a safe room or base. Simply locate an area free of enemies or hazards and press a button on your gamepad. Oh, and respawning at these locations won't heal you; if you saved with one health point left, you'll have to continue in the same state. If you get yourself into a jam, you can use your teleport device to return to the surface.There are no checkpoints, so you'll want to save constantly. Death arrives quickly and in a variety of forms. The traps and natural threats are the ones that hurt the most. While weak enemies only take one health point from you, bombs and laser gates instantly kill you unless you have purchased an additional health point. The most common cause of death is being knocked into one of these by an enemy bullet. When navigating between rooms, I found it particularly fascinating that you only see the room layout and no objects. After the room is fully visible, enemies and destructible things appear instantly. It's difficult to explain, but it demonstrates that the developers are well-versed in the period; it's a minor element that complements the game's overall aesthetic.The enemy variety and design are both rather good. The presence of an entity known as \"The Agent\" can be seen throughout the base, and the black mold has taken possession of all lifeforms. Bosses are essential, and this game has a few. I like how these fights prioritize platforming patterns over shooting. However, they’re quite easy once you figure out their limited attack pattern.The color palette can be changed at any time from the pause menu. There’s a bunch of them and anyone will find the favorite that will stay with you from start to finish. Each option contains 4 colors. While the left and right are only different hues of white and black (or gray), it's the center two that actually make the difference. Obviously, not all colors work together. If you have a mild form of color blindness, like me, some settings may even make the experience uncomfortable. The Orion or Neptune palettes, for example, made my eyes hurt by making the screen pulsate. Wave is similar, but the colors are more subtle, and it quickly became one of my favorites. New palette options are unlocked by collecting specimen found in plain sight or hidden behind a breakable wall. A few notes here. The freshly acquired palettes, for starters, aren't marked. It's tough to keep track of which palettes are new when there are so many. It's also a pain to switch between them; you have to go through each one separately. And second, the breakable walls have no visual clue that there’s something behind them. Shooting at every wall section in the room is not fun.Music is great, it has that nostalgic ’80 feel with its synth beats. The intro, on the other hand, could benefit from a lower volume because the bass clashes with the narrator's deep voice. No big deal because that’s the only time you’ll be hearing it. The game relies solely on subtitles, which could require a minor tweak. All words are crammed into the upper portion of the large text box that displays during cutscenes, leaving the bottom part unused and making the text difficult to read. I believe that adding more space between lines would help.Achievements encourage you to replay the game and race against the clock. There's also a shooting gallery available right away, where you have to hit targets with a sniper, who is possibly the game's most underutilized character. The sniper is stationary; all you're doing is moving the crosshair and firing at targets. One final frustration for achievement hunters is that once you've completed the game, you can't go back and look for missing items. And the achievement for collecting 15 specimens did not unlock."}, {"username": "Rhooke", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Cute little metroidvania.

There's been an alien infestation, and it's your job as a band of mercenaries to investigate and destroy the mutant scourge!Whilst BIOTA is labelled a metroidvania, it's is more linear than you'd expect. The map is fully outlined from the start, and most biomes need to be approached in a set order. There's an elevator fast travel mechanic, allowing you to quickly return back to HQ. As a result, backtracking is, refreshingly, kept to a minimum, with repeated visits to areas only needed for story items, or if you want to find all the secrets and get that magical 100% completion. To access many of the locked biomes, pass cards or other items are required, instead of new skills. Health and weapon upgrades are sold at the various Black Markets scattered across the map. To mix things up, there's arcade style areas where you take control of a giant mech, a submarine and a space ship. The story campaign should last you 5-7 hours, and features two endings. There's an additional four characters waiting to be unlocked, along with time trial levels and a target shooting mini game. The graphics are highly customizable, with 24 colour palettes available from the off, with a further 30 to unlock while playing.

The game does a very good job at building anxiety due to the fact that most entity encounters are far and few between (at least at the start), and everything is procedurally generated so that no two games are the same, and you won't expect what you'll run into next. I also believe this game is a step up from the other walking-simulator Backrooms games due to the hunger, thirst and sanity mechanics, which you have to juggle along with dodging monsters or even occasionally fighting them, if you're lucky enough to find a weapon.On the flip side, some things I think the game should improve on; streamer class definitely feels a bit more significant than the other classes due to the fact I found a weapon about 99% of the time with it, while with other classes I'd be lucky enough to even find enough food and water on the ground. Some of the sound effects and screams also feel repeated on some entities, even on different floors, so that also took some immersion away. Finally, if you have the VHS and PS1-effects graphics on, on some floors, it is VERY difficult to see items on the floor (and on that note, it's also sometimes difficult just to pick up those items themselves!)Despite these shortcomings, the game is in early access, so I believe the developer is on the good path to making a great game right now.

I'm writing this because I like some elements and hope the creator will reconsider some of the issues in future work.Basically I feel like the game's problem is that too many of your choices don't matter. My first run I was choosing randomly and didn't get a single ascension but I got close to wave 50 and felt good. My second run I read up on how ascensions work and picked more strategically... and died a little before wave 50. I tried an entirely different strategy someone mentioned on the forums and again died around wave 50. I ignored all strategies and just went for damage: again I got to around wave 50.Even when I made bad choices my game ended up about the same. The first levels are relatively easy but eventually enemy health ramps up in the 40s and 50s and you get overwhelmed. There's nothing you can do at this point and you've probably spent 15-30 minutes getting that far.There are rogue-lite elements but they're mostly unimportant. It takes multiple games to earn one upgrade and even when you have them all it doesn't make a meaningful difference to your strength. Some of the alternate equipment is interesting but the game should really tell you that most of the staffs with interesting effects only deal half damage. Sucks to spend all your points on the homing staff only to find that it's basically useless in a game where enemies fill the screen.There ARE combos that seem able to stay ahead of the enemy curve. But they're relatively few and they're not necessarily very fun. More importantly the likely average gameplay isn't that fun. Most of the time your damage builds can't keep up, your defense builds get one-shot out of nowhere, and going all in on something different is unrewarding.

And your main goal is to survive to 10 minutes or beat certain bosses depending on the arena. And as you destroy enemies they drop experience that allows you to choose a card to level up your ship. And there's a huge variety of different cards from things that allow your ship to shoot more bullets, or ones that allow you to start firing torpedoes and more.And each upgrade can also be leveled up around 3-5 times depending on the upgrade. And there are also insane synergies you can get like if you max our the multishot card and the scythe card and you break open a red gem that can drop from certain enemies you can combine them into a crazy synergy that gives you two scythes.And you eventually unlock ultra synergies that allow you to combine two different synergies into an even crazier synergy. So I’ve gotten an ultra synergy before that turns my entire ship into a beast that is shooting giant green lasers at my enemies that was instakilling everyone.And the longer you survive in the arenas the more and more insane they get. They will start to throw literally hundreds and hundreds of enemies and it’s just so freaking satisfying to mow them down and see these little bright blue pixels of xp float to your ship and level you up and make you stronger and stronger. And although you “win” arenas at 10 minutes or by defeating bosses you can still just try to survive as long as you can and get a high score. And as you play the game you constantly level up an out of game progression system that unlocks more cards to find in the game, new ships to try out, new synergies and ultra synergies, new arenas and more. And you will also be able to unlock and level up different perks that you can attach to any ship by collecting different colored gems like the red gems I talked about earlier during runs. So you can tailor and customize any ship to your liking. So as an example I always put the lifesteal perk on all my ships because I love constantly healing back to full after I take some damage.And it’s hard to ignore how freaking good this game looks. The game has a super gorgeous neon light art style and all the different arenas are themed in different ways and colors and seeing thousands of orbs of xp spill out of enemies is just so freaking satisfying. The game also has an incredible soundtrack that matches perfectly with the gameplay and visuals.And even though the game is only $4 it has so much content and replayability and it’s still getting even more updates. The game is already incredible but after it gets a couple more updates it’s gonna be one of the best roguelites that have come out recently.

But there is a solution.There are already simulators for rocks, trees, goats, bears, and so many more things, but somehow no one had been bold enough to recreate the feeling of running your hand through a lush patch of grass.  Thankfully, that challenge has been met by Touch Some Grass.  Sure, you could dismiss this as another one trick pony, a gimmick, a ponzi scheme, a cry for help, or simply \"fake grass\".  Before you do, at least consider the facts.When we say \"grass\", most people mean the type you find making up a lawn, but grasses are quite varied, including wheat, bamboo, and even sugar cane!  Why, we wouldn't even be here if not for grasses.  We eat them, animals eat them, and if that's not enough, we also use them as fuel and building material!No wonder that grass has been revered throughout history.  Paintings have been made of it, songs have been sung, and even the famous haiku writer, Matsuo Basho, penned one of his most famous poems abut grass.\"Softly bending bladesEmerald green as we rollGrandma down the hill\"So go ahead, touch some grass.  Feel the power surge through you, making you stronger.  No wait, I'm thinking of the Hulk.  He's green too.  Anyway.  You can't get an authentic grass touching experience any other way, so give it a try.  You might just like it.  You might not want to stop.

Fun so far. Tried joining multi-player and the animals were glitchy - jumping forward and backward. Graphic options are good. Shake is too exaggerated, would like a subtle shiver more. Whole tree movement is a weird feature to have, very ent-like I suppose, but fun to pick your favorite spot. Realtime local weather would be a cool option but you can easily set it yourself. Look forward to growing in my grove."}, {"username": "Adam O'Hare", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "yes"}, {"username": "Brikz-The-Tank", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "„He who makes a tree of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man“"}, {"username": "Sol Invictus", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "If you don't like it, you can leaf it alone! 10/10"}, {"username": "FriendlyHousenerd", "score": "Recommended", "comment": "Fantastic dating sim for trees.
