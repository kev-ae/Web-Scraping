The game also has great ambiance with one standout example being the Forest themes sounding like the Guardia Forest from Chrono Trigger (SNES). Everything about this game feels great, but I want to make it understood that you *MUST* read the Instruction Manual pieces that you pick up. Other than that, the game is a great title to explore and just get lost in."}, {"username": "SternOne", "comment": "Tunic is both rare and meticulous.Beautiful art design and a 'just-hard-enough' level of difficult combat combine well, as Tunic alights the imagination with a highly specific and unique reverence: one that speaks explicitly to the history of video games as a medium, what it was 'once like' to play them in a time lost to the ages, and what it was like to experience discovering a new one (lightly used). Once upon a time, people would rent video games from local retail stores. What came with any particular game, who could say. Sometimes, they would include instruction books with passwords left in the notes section. A Mega Man save image map, hand drawn.These traces were the remnants of a run through the game left unfinished, lost to its original player and time, now in your hands for the first time. Tunic is a game that simulates such a feeling, compelling in its player a simple truth, slowly: you are not the first. But here is what someone else has learned."}, {"username": "SkullFire58", "comment": "I've been keeping an eye on this game for a few years now, and I'm so glad it turned out to be this great, even better than I had hoped in fact. A fun, satisfying Zelda-like, with Outer Wilds style elements where progressing through the game reveals things that you didn't know were there all along. While the combat can be a little tough in the beginning, you can get better equipment and a feel for it quickly, solving puzzles and finding hidden paths is super satisfying, and discovering the secrets buried deep in this game gave me many moments of wonder and awe.

Stellar art direction & graphics, the sound design is deeply satisfying, and the amount of puzzles and secrets blew me away.The combat controls take a minute to get used to, but after that it's smooth sailing.

The game's fights progress in difficulty in a way that's not daunting, frustrating, or irrelevant with each new enemy and boss providing a unique experience that scales in a way you can simply feel your power and proficiency progress. The game's secrets are plentiful and range from in your face to galaxy brain, things that you'd never have even thought to consider prior that then open up entire new methods of thinking about the game and everything you've ever seen in it! Long story short -- the game is charming, clever, and you can tell just by playing a few minutes of it that an immense amount of time and love went into it's development. I wholeheartedly cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who likes open-world adventure, perplexing puzzles, and difficult combat.

And if you are not comfortable with super-competitive players having this game down to a science (i.e. knowing the best props to possess, knowing which combo works best with their friends, etc.) I would also not pick this up. There's no competitive v casual queue, so you go up against some REALLY aggressive players who want to win at all costs.If you are the competitive type and are willing to learn the meta stuff, by all means grab it. I just don't think I'm a fan just yet with the shape the game is in. I also don't really care for the model of unlocking tools/weapons/perks that should be available from the get-go.

It is not done.  Nothing can be really cheated or bought with real currency.  I like this game.   Play with friends, you'll have a great time."}, {"username": "DYNAMIC skills7", "comment": "its a fun game with friends and to try out fresh with everyone, but if you get it too late there will be nothing but tryhards and a lot of presented gameplay potential with various abilities and fun thrown out the window because their made useless with metas and the unending power of hunters making the game bland and boring in the end. best played in friend groups. heres some of the balance issues with ghosts below and the general flow of matches.the main issue is getting found too easily and being unable to escape. i suspect the harpoon nerf and slight movement change will not fix this. one issue is the hunters ability to spot. which applies a wall hacks to the props. this completely negates 2 abilities called phantom and miasma. escape potential is ruined. phantom which gives temporary invisibility, is instead used for movement based hiding to avoid an equipment called pathfinder to a degree, which tracks footprints and miasma being a slow damage applying mist has no noticeable effect against me as a hunter or ghost using it.ghosts are very punished for working hard to get 1 kill early. a hunter could be alone and you manage to get the jump on him and barely survive to consume him, maybe losing a teammate in the process and then the other 3 just kill you and revive him. not getting killed to prevent the enemy revive option is a tough order when 3 others can never lose track of you for the whole match and they generally have enough time to make it to him. hunters who split up should be punished in my opinion because it gives the ghosts a weakness to work with and helps the hiding slightly. the current balance makes sense on paper because ghost can revive too, but were talking about 2 different sides here that need their own balance. i think when a ghosts consumes someone they should have a time limit until their back or only come back at midnight as backup. splitting up is rare anyway as comp teams should always be coordinating equipment mostly in teams of 2. hunters hp can not always be seen either so you dont know what to do with them and the safest logical option is attempting escape. instead of limiting options, players should be punished for bad health management too, but the bar is hidden making it a gamble!. making deaths actually matter for hunters i feel is a great dynamic added to the match and feels much more rewarding. but alas such a thing doesnt exist.hunters counter literally every play style a ghost can have.spirit which lets you fly is countered by damaging the spirit form which i assume burning hard counters too.doppelganger letting you take the form of a hunter is very noticeable in a comms team and in small groups of 2 splitting up and no one takes friendly fire.poltergeist which raises objects and then throws them when a hunter is close warns you its rising up from quite a distance away too and shooting it knocks them down. the main comp strat here would be to have a chased teammate run into a poltergeist room to escape, but theres multiple problems with this. hunters could be cutting the ghost off from the other side, the hunters can corner check the room, the hunters can run past floating objects and have them miss, the floating objects commonly deal 11 damage so it doesnt really matter and i dont know if this value can go up if furniture hits the head or hits at a closer distance.telekinesis which lets you throw a object at people after a charge up and careful aiming just alerts hunters of your nearby presence and is cancelled by shooting it again. also hard to hit on any hunter movement.trickster which lets you move a object buys 2 seconds of attention from a hunter and if theres 2+ youre not going to be using this power to pull any kind of escape.apparition which sends a dumb ai clone out on the same path is mostly a gamble. you could pretend to be a apparition to escape which wont work if shot and if used when hiding it just leads a trail of plasma straight to you and tells the hunters which direction youre in...deaths grip which traps hunters until they shoot it works great if a solo hunter is on the case but again useless with 2+ people chasing and getting pinged so they know where to catch up to.corrupter which puts a bomb on objects is pointless for shooters that know the explosion radius of this ability, but has the great addition of throwing off spectrphones that detect ghost presence, but why would anyone use a spectrophone when the radar detects you immediately at 0 plasma level, at decent ranges, and is not interfered by anything. this leads me to my next point.radars. ecoplasm which builds over time as you stay still hiding apparently gives your position away more. but is absolutely pointless and very dissatisfying to even try hiding now. you have a hunter equip radar at spawn with lightweight and he immediately starts speed running all the rooms to pick up even a fraction of a reading which can happen at even the smallest % of plasma and then he immediately pings the room and scours it to find and kill you. the range of the radar looks to be around 5 metres at very low ectoplasm which is still far too much.its ok to have some bad abilities in the game that could serve the purpose of being fun, but in this case theres nothing that definitively helps in the grand scheme of things while hunters have no where near as much weaknesses or competition. the meta seems to be a radar runner with a pathfinder and everyone running lightweight and their never gonna need a midnight build. if a ghost needs vaccuming to prevent revives 1 or 2 just go back to the store where they can change their equipment in game to get it. attacking the hunter store results in death if they expect you to try it too because of pathfinder and cutoffs for retreat. the dead ghosts leaving a fake trail is a gamble and lightweight lets people catch up again when ghosts chill them, slowing their speed for 2 seconds.i dont know how responsive the devs are but i havent seen many comments about these issues and the discord cant even be

For those of you who have played your fair share of online competitive multiplayer games, this is a pattern I am sure you are familiar with.1. Notice the game in the \"New and Trending\" list2. Decide to fork over $20 to try it out3. Have a blast for 2-3 hours while you slowly start to understand the nuances of the mechanics4. Eventually get matched into a game with people who have been playing the game nonstop since beta5. Realize that apart from a few key abilities and weapons that are easily exploitable, most of the hunter upgrades you spent hours unlocking are pretty useless compared to the harpoon gun + ecto sensor6. Realize that hiding as a ghost is less effective than simply finding the smallest object in a level and spending the whole game darting around, dodging the hunter's attacks until midnightThe game advertises itself as a fun \"hide and seek\" game. This is false. MGH game is basically Call of Duty dressed up to look like a fun prop hunt game to play casually.Unfortunately, I don't see these as issues that can be fixed through anything short of a total overhaul of the mechanics. The developer's claim that the \"win rates hover around 50 / 50\" simply reinforces my opinion that any nerfs made to gameplay elements like hunter ammo, harpoon limitations, etc. will actually throw the game balance out of whack unless nerfs are made to the ghosts as well.Overwatch had a similar issue when the pro scene discovered GOATS comp, which ultimately led to the enforcement of team comp in QP and Ranked play. Bottom line: there's just no good solution to mechanics that are this fundamentally opposed to what the game is advertised as.Before I wrap up, I do want to recognize that the developers seem to be very responsive, passionate, and invested in working with their community to make this game great.

There is Pokemon, with IV breeding, Sonic Adventure with the Chao Garden, Planet Zoo... and then there is Wobbledogs.Wobbledogs scratches that itch in a way that the other games can't. At first glance the game doesn't look like much. It's very rectangular, very wobbly, the music is repetitive, and there isn't a significant amount to do. But it makes up for what it lacks in sheer number of legs. See, the point of the game is to crossbreed the lovable near-gelatinous dogs over and over until you've created an abomination worthy of its own entry in the Monster Manual, and from what I have seen the community is still debating on if there are any limitations besides your own hardware. You can just keep breeding more legs onto them. More heads. More tails. Or have a dog with 3 heads, one wing and no legs. I bred a table once.While the dogs(?) aren't having their DNA shoved into a breeding simulation machine of questionable reliability, they live in very cute and customizable habitat cubes that can be connected with hamster tunnels. Furniture items can be easily unlocked by capsule balls that are... dropped by your dogs(?), and there are many ways to create unique and fun habitats.Wobbledogs are also virtual pets requiring care and attention. You need to feed them, clean up their excretions, pupate them as they come of age, and account for their mobility issues as you breed them into non-functionality. What you feed them has an impact on how they grow and mutate, so you do need to take care with their diet. Your reward for this hard work is a single unfertilized egg, which can be used to make more abominations. After that they either live in storage for all eternity, or they exist until they die. If they die after you did a good job taking care of them, it rewards your other dogs(?) with a \"feast\". Actually it does that if you did a bad job. This game isn't very punishing.There is a very simple way to save and share your dogs, so you and your friends (or random strangers) can crossbreed your unique abominations together into some sort of obscene collaboration.Overall this is a really fun and addicting game. The art style grew on me, like extra legs, and the gameplay is simple and doesn't have much depth, but it is entertaining enough to hold my attention.

Looking forward to future updates. Highly recommended!"}, {"username": "bearsic", "comment": "TL;DR: Game is about 10 hours of good paced content, then grinding. I hope the game developers use the cash injection to really work on this product to flesh it out further which could make this game really good. As others have said, try the demo, the demo is representative of the first 10 hours of play. It is similar in flavour of sub nautica. Do the calculation of 10 hours of good game for the price tag of your country and see if that is of good value, the demo is maybe the first 3-4 hours(the save carries over from demo to full game) EARLY GAMEPacing is good, feels good to travel around and explore, you only need a few of the machines and you just upgrade them as you unlock newer versions, which keeps progress going. Since its minimal management on that end, you can explore while the number ticks up. Exploration is alright, I will say some places can be very hard to find, as they can be just a tiny ladder in a corner, but all the main monuments are...pretty basic, go in, break barrier, take loot, go home. you go in and out maybe 3 times to collect all the loot. LATE GAMEWhen you get to around the 10 hour mark, you have unlocked all the terraforming equipment, at least most of it. at that point in the game you just unlocked something for like lets say 10,000 points, that means in 10 hours you generated 10,000 points, the next unlock is like 10,000,000 points, so it goes from a game of unlocking stuff and exploring into a game of 'okay time to get to work' and you just have to start crafting a bunch of the drills and heaters and such to start bumping all your numbers up. The problem with this is getting materials, right now to obtain the mid/late game materials, you have two options after draining the map of them, you 'summon' them from rockets, which you don't get a ton of the resources and its a manual process of going to go collect all the resources, it just isn't really 'fun' its just a chore, collect materials to build rocket, send rocket,wait for rocks, keep rough track of where they all land, go mine the rocks, repeat process. It also doesn't help that the rockets require the same resources that they are dropping, so if you collect 20 red ore, you have to use 6 to get another rocket, so you only really got 14, while spending maybe 30 minutes doing so.The alternative is ore drills, these would be great, if not for one flaw, you place this in specific areas to get specific materials, sounds great, put the ore drill in the red cave to get red ore, sounds easy enough. The problem is these ore miners have limited space, lets say like 15, now 15 of red ore would be great, the problem is the miners don't collect JUST the red ore, they collect maybe 1 red ore for every 4 'junk' ore and you are left with 3 red ore after it has mined for 10-20 minutes. These ore miners are not super easy to make, they take a long time to fill up, and they get filled with junk, but they are the only way to get some materials like aluminium, so you are forced to act like an errand boy, going from drill to drill, collecting resources, and dumping the junk ore into storage(or on the floor in a giant pile) This is a pretty annoying part of the game, but the good thing is, it is an easy fix from the developers. I want the drill to just drill what I need, If I want junk ore, I can put the drill in a 'common' area and get it that way, I don't want this mix of ores. To add onto this, because the drills have to be in specific areas, those areas are pretty far apart, even with max level jets and such, just going back and forward so many damn times, I've spent most my time doing just that.If the devs take the early access money, build up both the story more, the unlocks more and expand the exploration a bit more and maybe add a bit of teleporting so you aren't traveling so damn far to do things, this teleportation would also be good BEFORE the grind wall, so you can get to and from the drills and such easier.overall, try the demo, it made me want to buy the game, but if you are tight for money, maybe hold off another year."}, {"username": "LYS", "comment": "finally, a normal human developed game, aiding your customer, good, i appreiated that."}, {"username": "humi", "comment": "A really good lofi collect and craft game.

Sometimes if you make a game less technical, like most other scifi-survival sandbox games, the game feels more open to casual players. (Which I believe the devs are aiming for)So if you're looking for something hardcore e.g. survival types like the forest, Green hell or Icarus, you might stay away from this one. As there is no combat and never will be. On the one hand it's a shame that not even aggressive \"alien-creatures\" would exist. But it's also refreshing there is no combat in such a game as this one. So far there are no skills to learn or xp system. Only tech to unlock when terraforming the planet. However, a lot of interesting features have been planned for full release, (Check the EA FAQ) I can't wait to see what more they can do with their game. There are a lot of visual glitches and certain animation glitches, but I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs so far. Storywise is very lacking, there are places you can visit to explore for the \"lore\", but it's very limited. More story content is planned. The text messages you currently can find are a bit too \"neutral\" and it feels like you want to know more about why and what you're doing there. (it is explained but it's very simple), But again, according to the EA FAQ, more story content will be added. Recommend? I'd say yes if you're looking for a casual \"survival\" sandbox scifi game. As fun as it is, because it is a simple game....But it feels lacking at times if you have played a game like Satisfactory. But this is still an EA game, and we can only hope this game will only improve in the end. So far I have enjoyed most of what the game has to offer, so I'll probably leave this game as is, and return when they release the full game or perhaps after a big content update."}, {"username": "Hamertime94", "comment": "Sad to leave a thumbs down as I have enjoyed my 13 hours so far. The start feels like a good survival game, then this gradually gets easier, surviving becomes very easy/not a part of the game at about 7 hours in, then you start automating the mining process, all of this was great.Now though, I look at what is in front of me. Jet-packing between my multiple miners to grab resources (which frustratingly produce multiple other junk resources making this a longer process), to produce things while there is no threat to me/no survival aspect. Satisfactory overcame this by making logistic systems, whereas in this game the next bit will just involve myself moving back and forth a few dozen times. So I'm staring into the last 5 hours of this game finding little enjoyment at this last leg of the journey. What worries me too is that the developers are planning on extending this portion of the game (making amphibians, insects, etc.) but there is no puzzle, no chance of failure, just plug in hours and get said answer.The initial thrill of the game came from the challenging survival, short lengths of time you can survive outside, prioritising the way through the puzzle with the interesting story.

It is quite simply one of the best maps I've ever seen in a videogame.But that's where the good things end. This is a game entirely carried by its environment. The combat is underdeveloped and gets dull quickly, there's barely any enemy variety, the open world activities are basically a bunch of ubisoft tier collectathons, and the story feels like a complete afterthought with how uninteresting it is.It feels like what happened here is that they made the map and then realized they had to make a game around it, so they scrambled to fill it up with content and shipped it as soon as possible. This is a rushed product, not in the usual sense of being buggy, but in the sense that its core concepts haven't been developed enough.I'd love to see Ghostwire becoming a series that takes us to different places across the world with their local environment und culture on display, but before that can happen, Tango Gameworks has to sit down and rework the mechanics of Ghostwire. Make the combat deep and engaging beyond some sparkly animations. Give us a great range of different enemies that we actually have to approach differently from each other. Invest time into making a compelling story with interesting characters. And make open-world content that makes the exploration of your beautiful worlds even more fun rather than less so. Ghostwire has alot of potential and can become a great game series, but as it currently stands it's not there yet.

It focuses around Japanese folklore, which normally I don't care about, but it makes each new discovery interesting.  It then adds on a huge amount of collectibles of various types, randomly hidden all throughout the city, which improve your character in some way - which can be discouraging for some, but I found it engagingUnfortunately, that's part of the problem; I did a lot of the sidequests, and collected a lot of things.  I'm now 8 hours in and have fully upgraded all my combat abilities, and I don't think there's really anywhere left to go.  This is what combat is going to be like for the next 30 hours or so.  Which is sorta fine, because it's still enjoyable, but I'm not sure it will be enjoyable 30 hours later.  Otherwise, many of the quests are also very hollow; they exist only to show you some creature from folklore, and then you hold down the 'absorb power' button and it dies and you get a reward.The rewards also stop feeling rewarding when you see that after 8 hours of meticulously grabbing every one you find, you're at 20,000/250,000 And speaking of finding things - you get an ability with no cooldown, that lets you see any interactable object, or enemy, through walls in any direction, for quite a long distance.  This makes the collectible business trivial and tedious; every few steps you stop, press the hotkey, look around/up/down/everywhere, try to figure out if any of the dozen outlines currently being shown are anything useful, move forward a few more steps, repeatSo, it's a maybe for me.  I still plan to keep going with it, and just avoid/ignore the collectibles, and see how it all plays out.  And on its surface, it really does look and feel great.

I also enjoyed the flavour text and reading all the descriptions and KK Notes in full. I know this can be boring and tedious to some people but that's why if you want to not bother with it, you can just play through the story. The story is of a mad scientist and his efforts into separating the soul from the body  but focused around a young man fused with a ghost who was one such soul separating from his body. They team up to kick ass and reverse the separation and put everyone back into their bodies. It's a very quick story to get through and the ending got me super emotional. Tears lined my face I tell ya! I would be interested in a sequel of sorts to see if Akito (young man protagonist) continues to vanquish otherwordly foes or help those with spirit problems. Definitely room to expand the world or leave it as it is.I think it's a lovely game for sure. It balances campy with grit very nicely but won't be a game for everyone.

Catch it on sale."}, {"username": "Solid Gamer", "comment": "★☆☆☆☆ TerribleFar Cry 2: TokyoThis is without a doubt the most disappointing game I've played this year.First off, I went into this game with the perfect mindset. There is so much wrong in this game that I can't understand how someone could give this high ratings. There is not a single pinch of love put into this game that I can feel. It feels like the only person that really wanted to make the game was Ikumi Nakamura (the ex creative director of the game) and when she left, the other devs were forced to finish this game which created this cesspool of a video game.When I saw the combat through the gameplay trailers, I was excited. It looks great and the animations are badass then I saw the amount of elements and I was like \"Wow, can't wait to see what other badass attacks I can throw at my enemies\". The fact that there are only 3 elements and each of them only has 2 attacks, light and heavy. THAT IS IT. For a 10 hours game, this is pathetic. The skill tree is a joke. Even with there being only 3 elements, I was still somewhat optimistic. The upgrades are boring and dreadful. \"Increase the width of your water element attack from 1m to 2m\". There's also nothing for the melee department. There isn't anything like summoning a fire sword that you can use against enemies. This is creatively bankrupt and it shocks me that the man who made this studio was Shinji Mikami. It is embarrassing that his name is now put into this game.The combat also doesn't improve with the poor array of enemy types. The enemies have cool designs even tho most of them look identical. The way their attacks are choreographed are all quite different. The flaw here is that 95% of enemies require the same way to kill which is by spamming everything you have at it. Only one enemy that actually forced me to change elements and that is the fat shield guys because you gotta use the water elements since it's like shotgun. This just makes combat way more bland than it already is. This world is the definition of empty. The map screen is so cluttered with icons: there are telephone booths everywhere in this game, why did the developers have the need to place all of them on the map screen? Same goes for the flying demons. They felt like they need to show everything on the map, no matter how badly it effects the experience as a whole.The worst aspects of this open world is definitely collecting spirits. There are a total of 240000 spirits you need to collect (probably 35-40 hours of all game). How do you collect spirits you may ask? Well, you hold the right mouse button. You do this for every single spirit you find. And then there's the side quest which I gave them a chance. In this game, you talk to random souls that all have the exact same design. There is absolutely no way for anyone to be interested in whatever is happening to these people.95% of buildings in this game you can not enter and when there are, it is stopped by a loading screen and you're teleported into the building. What year is this? Am I back in 2012? Even Yakuza Kiwami fixed this problem long ago. What a joke.Story: the most generic anime plot to ever exist. Blank protagonist who cares for his blank of a sister who is working with a blank detective to save Tokyo from a blank villain. That's the best way I can put this story. The acting is also weak, the amount of overacting in this one is hilarious and no scene will even touch your emotions.Ghostwire: Tokyo the only way to describe the game comes in mind = colossal disappointment!"}, {"username": "zuppaclub", "comment": "main story is too short ( chapter 5 and 6 are just like a breeze, 1 small area, bosses and cutscenes ), do not ride the bike if you still want finding collectibles, etc.film grain effect must be remove or add on off toggle, it makes the graphics looks bad ( I remove it via file edit thanks to one of user post , you could check it on discussion )jumping from the building, trying to gliding , many times makes me want to punch my monitor, I press jump, it won't jump and I fall down from the building, it's like a delay responseI like small details, like if you near collectible, there is a meow sound, or when some of type of enemy near you, for example scrissor lady, the building or environment near you will changed to red mess.I really like bosses design and attack pattern, even though their human design are forgetable except the hannya mask one.I hope there will be a prequel / sequel / expansion DLClong story short, it's ubisoft open world type of game, which I loved it."}]}, {"game_id": "1911390", "game_title": "Knightfall_A_Daring_Journey", "reviews": [{"username": "SANDhater", "comment": "Honse do the drift"}, {"username": "Lesson 5 Johnny", "comment": "Beats out Elden Ring for goty by a large margin, because you can't horse drift in Elden Ring"}, {"username": "Novieus", "comment": "Died in the cold cause I wanted the rose too badly, friend died cause he missed the horse too much.13/10 Would die for romance again."}, {"username": "Hex: Become Human", "comment": "Most fun I've had gunfighting since Titanfall 2."}, {"username": "Yoona", "comment": "hourse balls"}, {"username": "Cubby", "comment": "GREATEST GAME SINCE EVER!!!

In short, it is a creature collector JRPG with 1v1 (mostly, there are rare, but sometimes occurring 1v2 and 1v3, also I'm not taking into account PvP) turn-based battles. Coromon is, obviously, inspired by Pokemon, but if I had to say, it is inspired most of all by more older versions of Pokemon, like Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald.There are more than 100 (114 according to Corodex, however, due to specifics of some Coromon that I'll refrain from spoiling, I'd just say that there are over 100 of them) Coromon. Some have 3 stages of evolution, some just 2, nothing genre-breaking or game-redefining. There's no breeding, or different branches of evolution, so Coromon're all about just catching. There are 3 variations of each. Standard, Potent and Perfect. If you'd thought of Shinies, you are correct, as well as not.Standard Coromon appear 97.09% of the time (3101 to 3194), Potent 2.88% (92 to 3194) and Perfect 0.03% (1 to 3194). There's a Potency scale, which defines which one of the three they are. 1 to 16 Potency are Standard, 17 to 20 are Potent, and 21, which is a maximum of Potency, are Perfect. Potency defines how much XP you need before you'll receive 3 free stat points for a Coromon. The more Potency, the less XP is needed to acquire them. Basically, it's like additional level ups that go hand-in-hand with your usual XP progression. That means that unlike purely-cosmetic Shinies, Perfects can be stronger than their Standard counterparts. You may think of those free points as EV (Effort Values), even though that is not entirely true. For PvE it doesn't mean much, however if you're into that, stat changes will be noticeable and will make your creatures stronger, especially later on.There is a major flaw of this game, and it is it's oldschoolity in some of the design. I'm talking about unskippable/slow animations, strange inventory/menu management, long, unneeded transitions. I've spent 24 hours of the game for 3 first sections of it and then I've given up. I didn't want to speed up the game, but I just couldn't bear it. I've beat last 3 sections of the game in 6 hours. x4 times faster than first half of the game. And I didn't skip content, I've still collected all the Coromon, looted everything, seen the map, etc.I liked the animations, they are really awesome, as well as Coromon's visuals. However, I really don't want to spend this much time watching the same animations happen a thousand time. You cannot speed them up via game settings, skip is out of question as well. I honestly recommend getting used to the game at it's usual speed, watching those sweet attack animations and such, and when you are used to the gameplay loop and are able to respond to enemies' attacks accordingly, just speed it up. If I would've completed the same game in, let's say, 15 hours, instead of 30, I would've been really happy with it. Now, I really do grieve over so much time spent on weird management and needlessly prolonged battles. Though I still did enjoy the game.Thank you for reading, I hope you'll enjoy Coromon with or without the need to use a cheat engine or such."}, {"username": "Dust", "comment": "Playthrough in ProgressUpdate: This is not a pokemon-like game, this is a game of minigames and puzzles disguised as a pokemon-like.

Has tons of feature for min-maxers for tweak their coromon. This game definitely seems aimed at those sorts rather than a chill pokemon-like game, very tedious so far.Why it’s tedious: Entirely linear, no exploration or multiple areas to train in. No secrets to be found, or side routes to be explored. Would be less of an issue if it wasn’t so grindy.Lots of puzzles – Battling often does feel like it takes a back seat to many puzzles.Excessive number of wild encounters, even when using repellent~Useful when grinding, a pain when just trying to travel. Excessive mandatory trainers blocking your paths~The equivalents of Gyms are huge and have a Gyms worth of trainers on each floor. Only thing making it bearable is I enabled regen on level up and half price shops. Otherwise I would regularly be out of items and have to backtrack to healing centers.Excessive Grinding: Even a 2-3 level difference will lead to bosses stomping your coromon, even when of an opposing type. And the excessive encounters above are still insufficient to have you at proper level by the time you reach a boss.

As much as Id like to judge it solely on its own merits the comparison is hard to ignore but that's to be expected when competing with the largest franchise on Earth.  The Good 1. Creature Design: Coromon seems really dedicated to creating monsters that largely feel like they fit into a living breathing world, something that Pokemon seems to have less and less interest in. While I don't mind things like objectmons (Voltorb, Vanillish), I really can't stand ones that look like a Halloween costume or just set characters rather then a species of creature (Inteleon, Incineroar). Coromon's design focus leans into things that resemble functional animals for the most part with some deviations into the supernatural or technological, and its a solid design decision I hope they stick too. I should also mention that the sprite work in general is excellent. 2.Stamina as a Resource: Coromon's battle system sets it apart from pokemon while opening the door to new strategic options and potentially keeping weaker moves relevant. Its a far more engaging decision to know that spamming that powerful move could lead me to needing to skip a turn rather then just being unable to use it after 5 times. This change also effectively neuters PP stalling, while energy draining moves offer a more interesting replacement. 3. The Story: I know its a low bar but Coromon has a far more engaging main story then any recent pokemon game. Having a character that actually talks and emotes helps a fair bit in that regard as well. I wouldn't call it excellent, but its perfectly serviceable to carry you along a first time playthrough. 4. Difficulty: Coromon has a highly customisable set of difficulty options to cater to multiple playstyles and playthroughs. This is a welcome change to some of the frankly nonsensical options Pokemon has on offer like needing to beat White 2 in order to unlock easy mode or stripping away options for players to customise their experience in SWSH. In Coromon on normal difficulty the bosses and even some random trainers have put their foot down when I assumed they would be pushover fodder, while in SWSH the notion of a possible defeat never even came into my mind until the final boss. Coromon is also not afraid to get tough in some segments where it forbids you from using items or to win with just your team building knowledge. 5. Potential and Training: In Coromon shinies have an actual purpose, as being potent (semi shiny) or perfect (shiny) give them more points to spend when they level up their potential. I think the Potential system is far FAR better then EV's and IV's for customising and differentiating different Coromon. Coromon in general is leagues more transparent in your teams actual stats and how you can influence those stats to build your ideal team. Coromon is also much more generous with ways to both find/create more potent coromon, as well as levelling them up quickly throughout the game. My only gripe with this is that at times I felt like I was somewhat missing out when I settled for a standard mon, although standard mons are perfectly capable of taking on the games challenges.6. Traits: Coromon is also a lot more liberal with the passive abilities it puts at your disposal. While I liked the idea behind hidden abilities in Pokemon, when certain pokemon require their hidden abilities to work it can quickly turn into a slog trying to get your ideal fighter. None of that here, not only do some coromon have access to 4 abilities no strings attached, you can also reroll abilities fairly early in the game. I also like the idea of biome specific traits, it keeps the spirit of hidden abilities while being more accessible and adding flavor to the world. The Bad 1. Evasion and Accuracy: You remember how annoying it was to get sand attack spammed at you by a pidgy? Or when a trainer used double team over and over? Well there's a fair bit of that in Coromon, and its just as frustrating here as it is in Pokemon. While it makes sense that kicking up a sandstorm would make it harder to land an attack turning a 100% accuracy move into a dice roll just isn't a fun mechanic. If they were really set on keeping the effects personally I would add something like X-Com's graze effect, where you have a chance to mitigate the attack rather then completely negate it. Maybe if your opponent has lowered accuracy and you have heightened evasion you could still succeed in completely negating the attack but it requires more investment. Powerful moves having a chance to miss is a good trade off, but when my opponent can turn every move into a roulette I believe the gameplay suffers.2. Animation Length: While I mentioned earlier that the sprite work is by and large excellent, and that holds true for the move effects, some effects seem to take up more time then necessary and when your using them often this can become annoying. This is especially true for some multi hit moves like Heated Horns which have the attack animation play out multiple times for each successful strike. This is in sharp contrast to a move like Multi Bolt which fires off all its successful blasts in lightning (heh) quick fashion. This is more of a nitpick then any deal breaking issue but I don't think it would hurt to trim down some of the animations to keep battles moving along. 3. Linearity: In general the world of Coromon is explored in a mostly straight line. This is something of a slump mainline pokemon games have found themselves in as well. While there are some goodies and quests to find off the beaten path you're going to be on a tight leash as far as the major areas are concerned. Again nothing of a deal breaker but Id love to see a more open world design from this series in the future. 4. Audio Nitpicks: Having nearly every Coromon's cry being its name like Pokemon do in the show was an ambitions choice. For the most part I think they did a good job with shortening/changing/distorting the cry so it sounds more like a creature then a person, but there are a few examples (looking at you Kyraptor) where it definitely feels forced. Coromon having a defeated cry would also would be nice but that's more of a wishlist sort of thing. My other issue with the audio is that certain moves like Poison Sting are way louder then others for some reason. This could be an issue with my machine but I'm honestly not sure. 5. No Trading or Co-op: Trading is something the entire potential and traits system seems to be begging for, and to their credit TRAGsoft has expressed interest in adding it. At time of writing its still absent and is sorrily missed, I got 2 potent Purrgy's and wish I could give one to my friend who is also enjoying the game. Co-op is admittedly a big ask, but it was the highlight for me when playing SWSH. I would also feel a lot better about recommending Coromon to other friends if we had a way to play together that wasn't direct PvP. Maybe remixed Titan battles with friends?6. Bugs: This game still has a few bugs, but the devs are putting out patches to fix them so this is more of an acknowledgement then a complaint. I haven't experienced anything especially disruptive or game breaking but if the notion of bugs is a no deal for you then maybe give it a bit more time.  Final Thoughts Overall Iv really enjoyed my time with Coromon and its great to see a smaller studio make improvements on a formula that the mainstream has gotten a bit too comfortable with (a comparison to Stardew Valley comes to mind). It has a lot of replay value with its customizable difficulty and I can definitely see myself replaying it in the future. I think Coromon is setting off on the right foot and while it has some room to grow I look forward to what it has in store for the future."}, {"username": "FunkMasterChunk", "comment": "I've been loving Coromon. The game is fantastic and reminds me of the days as a kid playing Pokemon Red and Blue on my Gameboy. I haven't had any issues with it so far, not even a single bug. The devs have been awesome at responding to the player bases' feedback, and have already added several QoL (quality of life) changes to the game.

The game is also more engaging as it's a lot more challenging than Pokémon. Status ailments and stat debuffs are actually really useful and the general balance of types seems to be a lot better.

It captures the magic of the original Pokemon games while thankfully ramping up the difficulty. Sadly there are only 116 Coromon, but the game is diverse enough that it doesnt hold it back too much. The potential system allows you to choose stats for your Coromon which to me is a game changer. It means no two Coromon will ever be the same and no more hidden values like in Pokemon, as this basically lets you choose those values.There are public and private multiplayer options which allows you to compete to be the very best!

If you liked Cultist Simulator, you'll probably like Stacklands.Stacklands has a lot of simple parts that are stuck together in a novel way. The main gameplay loop sits somewhere between a rogue-lite deck builder, a survival game, and a town builder/management game. The cards are \"physical objects\" that can bump into each other or be dragged around and stacked manually, everything moves in real time, your play area is limited (though it can be upgraded), and you must sell any cards that exceed your \"hand size\" at the end of a day. As you accrue more cards you must figure out a way to deal with the clutter, be it by stacking, selling or crafting, all while making sure you've got enough food at the end of the day to keep your villagers from starving. You end up with a finger in a lot of pies, and it can be enjoyably hectic as you try to balance progress with survival.I'm not sure how to rate it in terms of replayability.

Moodier lighting instead of shiny and sparkling lighting FX would have lent a better feel to the visuals.Sound:Weapons sound nice and punchy, maybe a little too much so in the case of the shotgun, it's deafening. But for the most part, solid. The music is kinda generic, lots of heavy guitar and drums. More of a heavy metal rip and tear vibe than eldritch horror, which isn't bad, but it does conflict with how much effort they put into making the art so creepy and alien. Missed opportunity to lean more into horror in some sections. Voice acting is corny and mildly annoying, I played as the Journalist, and she almost exclusively spouts lame \"action hero\" one liners akin to Bombshell from Ion fury, triggered by certain in-game actions like picking up health.Story:Completely and utterly forgettable. The story is mainly delivered by what sounds like someone doing their best Darkest Dungeon narrator impression. Something about chasing a relative or acquaintance for some reason to get a special Cthulu key, for some reason, and fight a cult for some reason. It's really bare-bones. The game is also filled with \"audiolog\" style content, little clues on the ground you can interact with to get a small tidbit of information. Calling them clues would be extremely generous though, they all pretty much tell you nothing. It's almost always some useless scrap of mundane information that you don't have the context to understand or care about. I doubt even serious lore nerds will find themselves getting invested in hunting for these little nothings. I stopped checking them about 2 levels in.Gameplay:The shooting is crisp and there is good hit feedback on enemies. Popping headshots is satisfying because of the gory animations. It's fast paced and requires constant movement and quick and accurate shooting. Hitboxes can be a little finicky and hard to hit sometimes, but for the most part the shooting is solid. A lack of alternate fire is disappointing, right clicking is instead the dedicated \"hold up flashlight\" button which also puts away your gun. This is only used for the predictable gimmick sections where they shut the lights out and you have to use the flashlight briefly to navigate. This really only happened right after the flashlight was introduced, and I basically never used it again. I chose hard mode for my first playthrough and that seems decently balanced for a first run for an experienced fps player, but I have noted some major flaws as I've progressed through the game. The first being the upgrade system.     You gain xp from killing enemies, and when you level up you get a point to unlock an upgrade from a tree with some branching choices. These range from simply gaining more health or armor to completely changing one of your guns into a different version. This is where some problems arise. Upgrade are permanent, you are locked in as soon as you select them. This would be a fine - if slightly annoying - design decision, if it weren't for the fact that these \"upgrades\" aren't always upgrades. I decided to \"upgrade\" my mp34, a reliable long range machine gun, into the grenade launcher variant. Once you have this variant, ammo for this weapon becomes extremely scarce, I found only one or two packs of 5 in very long branching levels, with multiple keys and sections. The grenade launcher must be extremely powerful right to justify this scarcity? No, not really, it's pretty weak. It has a narrow hitbox for direct hits, mediocre damage, and a very small explosion effect. A direct hit on common mid-tier enemies will result in dealing 2/3 of their health, and you only have around ~5-10 shots per level. Those kinds of enemies appear by the dozens. I could kill about 100x more enemies with the original, un-\"upgraded\" version of the weapon, as it was strong and had plentiful ammo. This is not the only example of getting locked into a downgrade either. I decided to try out the \"throwing knife\" upgrade for the basic knife. Whoops, this reduces the knife from a solid but risky fallback melee option, into what basically amounts to throwing pebbles at enemies. Throwing knives travel slowly in an arc and deal about 1/20th of mid tier enemies hp bar per hit. I'm in the middle of act 2 and I've essentially already deleted 2 weapons from my arsenal by locking myself into crappy versions with the upgrade system. Thankfully, not all the upgrades are like this (the eldritch shotgun upgrades are awesome and powerful) but for an upgrade system to be fun, investing points should always result in getting stronger or having more options to play with, not nerfing yourself. It wouldn't be so bad if you could redo your points or even unlock multiple variants, but right now getting stuck with a useless weapon for an entire playthrough is just extremely disappointing.      Unfortunately, this problem of giving the player weak tools carries over to another major aspect of the gameplay, which is the active abilities you can use every so often by racking up \"insanity points\". The list of abilities sounds cool on paper, an angelic life draining sword berserk mode, a camera flash that stuns enemies close to you, a voodoo doll that nukes in an AOE around you, and a temporary slowmo effect. These abilities should result in a cool big moment of power where you use them to turn the tide in your favor temporarily, and to an extent they are that, but they are mostly too limited to be really satisfying to use. The sword power up for instance, really suffers from the finicky hitboxes in the game. For some reason they decided that the hitbox of the sword would be exactly 1 pixel in the center of the screen that can hit exactly 1 enemy at a time and only if you're close enough for them to hit you back. The sword deals a decent amount of damage, but only restores ~10 hp per hit, and most enemies on hard mode hit for at least 20-40 damage per hit. This means that instead of resulting in a fun cool moment of slicing through hordes of enemies while stealing back health, it's actually almost never a good idea to use this power. All they would have to do to fix it would be to make it cleave across the screen instead, with a decent reach and ability to hit multiple enemies. Immediately, this power would be fun and cool to use. Similarly, the camera flash sounds decent on paper, but enemies have to be basically right next to you for it to work at all, and thus stunning enemies is rarely useful because most melee enemies are fodder and die in just a hit or two from any of the non-terrible weapons in the game. It's a flash effect right, why not just let it stun everyone looking at you? The voodoo magic explosion is fine, if a little underwhelming, and the slow-mo power is just about the only one that feels strong to use. Unfortunately, even this is hampered by the fact that you can't use any power in combination with the others! Why! Being able to slow down time to position a voodoo explosion, or go on a slow-mo rampage with the sword would actually make those powers more fun, but for some reason, you are limited to 1 at a time. Final thoughts:     It might sound like I hated played this game, but honestly, it's fine, I had some fun. It's just very frustrating that with some small tweaks like buffing some useless weapons, improving the power of the abilities and letting you use them in combination, and allowing you to respec or unlock multiple weapon variants would result in a experience that is way more fun. It's difficult to recommend this game for $20 when something like Dusk exists, but maybe if they come back and make some balance tweaks with an emphasis on improving the fun factor of some core features it wouldn't be."}, {"username": "Tamaster", "comment": "Sum-UpIn-depth analysis further down.🟩 Pros🟥 Cons- Unique visual style, that shows excellent art direction consistently.- Solid gunplay: each weapon feels diverse and fun to use.- A true but (mostly) fair challenge, even for FPS veterans, on the higher difficulty settings.- Good variety of enemies, gameplay variations and weapons to use / upgrade.- Overall solid boss design, despite some blunders.- Poor characters balance: Priest's skill-set is clearly superior to the Journalist's.- Terrible ammo economy in the latter two chapters.- The last chapter (Act 5) feels rushed, uninteresting and annoyingly-designed.- XP / leveling progression grinds to a halt further down the line.🟨 Bugs & Issues🔧 Specs- Rarely, some enemies may become invisible unintentionally.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:Took me about 11 hours to complete FMF on Hard difficulty (I admit switching to Normal in the last chapter, due to the awful ammo economy); this taking time to spot secrets and read lore files when possible.

Arena-based Endless Mode is present for those interested, as well.Is it worth buying?The base price of 20€ is fair for this amount of content and quality, considering the genre. I can safely recommend purchase at full price, as the many good points overcome the blunders by a large margin.Verdict: GoodRating Chart HereA solid entry in the Old-School Shooter subgenre. Despite some flaws, it proves fun and interesting to play for the most part. Fans of shooters will like the changes it introduces, while still staying true to the genre's roots.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720285In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingPlaying as either a Journalist or Priest, players will be called to a remote town in order to investigate a series of strange events, which culminated with the disappearance of the entire city's population. This gives an incipit for our protagonist of choice to go through increasingly maddening locales, in what soon becomes a struggle for survival. In an Old School FPS, expecting an elaborate story is out of the question; regardless, there are actually a good number of documents and indirect narration elements that give out clues, tidbits about the events that went down - inspired to the Cthulhu Mythos and other supernatural cults. Despite being an unimportant requirement for this genre, the writing itself is of good quality; the same can be said for voice acting and narration - even if the voice-lines do get rather repetitive in the midst of battle, after several hours. Overall, a solid mark in this department.Combat SystemThe prime activity in FMF will be, of course, shooting heaps of cultists, mutants, abominations and everything in-between. To do so properly, you'll progressively unlock new weapons found every couple of levels, each of them using different types of ammo and having a distinct purpose on the field - although there are some redundancies. Expect an old-school feel and pacing to the gunplay, as circle-strafing and kiting enemies around while vomiting lead are the peak strategies during combat... but not always! FMF does have several levels that encourage or even force a more considerate playstyle, as they hide enemies or other hindrances behind corners, walls and such obstacles, so you can't just rush and run as you'd think. It's a nice change of pace that forces you to reconsider your approach.Both characters have four different skills; on paper, the Priest's are more defensive while the Journo's encourage aggressiveness, and this is true to an extent. Especially later on, however, the former's skills will simply prove better, as you can't really compare powerful statuses like total invincibility or infinite ammo, with a relatively miserable AoE damage or slow motion that, while useful, just don't feel as good as the holy man's feats. Such skills can be used via Madness, a mana-like stat charged by either taking or dealing damage, granting permanent charges for each ability as it increases. All feats can be upgraded to enhance their effectiveness or duration significantly, but never their core functioning. Weapons may as well be upgraded with the skill points gained by slaying enemies, with mutually-excluding patterns that transform them into significantly better - or different - murder tools. In the end there's a choice to be made between favoring better weapons or better skills, as there're not enough skill points for everything in the long run.Enemies prove varied and interesting, with each act sporting many unique variations. Some of them have weak-spots that, when hit, cause them to mutate (generally becoming weaker) and change their behavior. This rewards accuracy and know-how, but isn't really a core mechanic, as it can be done only on a handful of foes compared to the total. All enemies, on higher settings, hit like trucks while healing and ammo are sparingly found; an issue that becomes overwhelming in the last act and makes it a frustrating, unbalanced mess of bullet sponges and ill-conceived layouts.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792999356General GameplayAside from the general slaughter, you'll want to take your time in finding secrets and lore files, present in almost every level. The bounties of supplies present in hidden areas can really make the difference between a resource-starved fighter and a ready-for-anything one. With how little ammo and health there is around, especially later on, you'll soon want to become a treasure hunter, no doubt. FMF uses fixed save points in the shape of a drunken hobo, appearing once in a while to retain your progress unlimited times, but only at fixed locations. You'll also want to find color-coded keys to open doors, as it's customary in the genre.Boss FightsEach act has one boss, and all of them, except maybe one (Act 4) prove decently designed, challenging and feel unique. These powerful foes feature evolving attack patterns as they lose HP, and often spawn additional minions you gotta deal with, or soon get overwhelmed by the crossfire. It feels like latter ones are a bit too much on the bullet-spongy side, but nothing too bad in this regard. Even if multi-phased, arena-swapping in some cases, all bosses must be restarted from the start without checkpoints in case of death, which is fine.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720181Other Game ModesAfter the main story, for those who really can't get enough, endless mode is present with five unique arenas where you have to survive as long as you can with either the Journalist or Priest, against increasingly powerful foes, on a difficulty setting of your choice - while upgrading yourself and your arsenal. Completionists and achievement hunters will get into this surely, but in the end it's just \"more of the same\" without significant variations."}, {"username": "ShamblingGoatMother", "comment": "Forgive me Father because I have sinned; I purchased off a grey market site some time ago and the least I can do now is tell you that It is indeed worth it full price off steam and leave a good review.

The store page advertises its \"lovecraftian ambiance\". That is NOT true. A lovecraftian ambiance would mean making slow, deliberate progress while being in constant danger from incomprehensible horrors that will kill you, while being surrounded by strange secrets. In this game, you zip around at mach 3 and shoot the horrors in the face with a shotgun, turning them into fine red mist, and read a few scattered notes here and there while your character makes quip.

The game quickly introduces the fight. Opponents have relatively large hitboxes which makes it easy to aim at enemies and quickly turn them into red slush.

Here, more powerful weapons come in handy and you can choose from a large arsenal. I like the approach to the character development tree.

I was very much looking forward to it.In all honesty, it's a perfect storm of small-ish problems. A repeatable swarm-esque mode is not a bad idea. The risk and reward and random elements are promising. The first problem is that your instructions as to how to access the Hives are bafflingly obtuse - you need to slog through regular missions and hope RNG goes your way - and while not difficult to gather from context clues (e.g.the campaign screen saying 'hives enabled') that leaves the player asking themselves questions about their understanding when they play for multiple hours as the character that can see entrances highlighted without encountering a single Hive.One of the mechanics in the Hives allow a single player to potentially royally screw over an entire team, which is unfortunate. The loot must be carried like a melee weapon, while the Hive enemy buffs seem to usually strongly discourage melee combat. And finally the loot per run - which, may I emphasize, you are seemingly only allowed to embark on via RNG - is capped at 3. I tried to figure out if you could submit skulls early at a rare exit without leaving and from what I can tell the answer is no. The dlc loot marketplace in the game refreshes on a shockingly short timer and is randomized with no clue when items will be back; this is a tactic usually used to incentivize microtransactions with steep FOMO. Since this game doesn't have microtransactions, I'm deeply confused as to why they made this choice; it hasn't been popularized because it's good or healthy, it became popularized because it manipulates people to spend money. When you don't do that, you just leave people feeling frustrated and disinterested that they won't be able to get anything they want for a long time.In truth, I think all of these wouldn't make the process so joyless if not for the RNG element of finding the Hive. And I'm someone that up to this update was still enjoying hopping into random games and experimenting with decks; repetitiveness of the missions wasn't a killer for me. But because you have to do regular missions to do Hives, when the Hive is your goal you end up impatiently enduring the mission searching for a Hive entrance and it doesn't put you in a good mindset. I spoke to a few people in random games and we'd all been searching for a Hive for quite a while with no luck.I want to be fair: letting people play DLC content in co-op with someone who owns it even if you don't is something I really appreciate. The recent update came with a variety of quality of life changes, which were awesome. Arguably the speed with which the shop refreshes means that sooner or later you can land on something you like regardless, once you save up enough. I sent my friend screencaps of Plague Doctor Doc and we lost our minds over it. But this launch feels a little muddled and frustrating, I can't lie. I sincerely hope there is a quality of life update for the DLC as well - or at the very least, someone in the community figures out a level where a Hive reliably spawns relatively close to the start, so I can stop feeling like a gameplay mode I normally enjoy is an annoying chore to endure until I can finally locate what I paid for."}, {"username": "𝓝𝓮𝓿𝓮𝓻 𝓛𝓾𝓬𝓴𝔂", "comment": "Ads nothing to the game!

If you liked Cultist Simulator, you'll probably like Stacklands.Stacklands has a lot of simple parts that are stuck together in a novel way. The main gameplay loop sits somewhere between a rogue-lite deck builder, a survival game, and a town builder/management game. The cards are \"physical objects\" that can bump into each other or be dragged around and stacked manually, everything moves in real time, your play area is limited (though it can be upgraded), and you must sell any cards that exceed your \"hand size\" at the end of a day. As you accrue more cards you must figure out a way to deal with the clutter, be it by stacking, selling or crafting, all while making sure you've got enough food at the end of the day to keep your villagers from starving. You end up with a finger in a lot of pies, and it can be enjoyably hectic as you try to balance progress with survival.I'm not sure how to rate it in terms of replayability.

Moodier lighting instead of shiny and sparkling lighting FX would have lent a better feel to the visuals.Sound:Weapons sound nice and punchy, maybe a little too much so in the case of the shotgun, it's deafening. But for the most part, solid. The music is kinda generic, lots of heavy guitar and drums. More of a heavy metal rip and tear vibe than eldritch horror, which isn't bad, but it does conflict with how much effort they put into making the art so creepy and alien. Missed opportunity to lean more into horror in some sections. Voice acting is corny and mildly annoying, I played as the Journalist, and she almost exclusively spouts lame \"action hero\" one liners akin to Bombshell from Ion fury, triggered by certain in-game actions like picking up health.Story:Completely and utterly forgettable. The story is mainly delivered by what sounds like someone doing their best Darkest Dungeon narrator impression. Something about chasing a relative or acquaintance for some reason to get a special Cthulu key, for some reason, and fight a cult for some reason. It's really bare-bones. The game is also filled with \"audiolog\" style content, little clues on the ground you can interact with to get a small tidbit of information. Calling them clues would be extremely generous though, they all pretty much tell you nothing. It's almost always some useless scrap of mundane information that you don't have the context to understand or care about. I doubt even serious lore nerds will find themselves getting invested in hunting for these little nothings. I stopped checking them about 2 levels in.Gameplay:The shooting is crisp and there is good hit feedback on enemies. Popping headshots is satisfying because of the gory animations. It's fast paced and requires constant movement and quick and accurate shooting. Hitboxes can be a little finicky and hard to hit sometimes, but for the most part the shooting is solid. A lack of alternate fire is disappointing, right clicking is instead the dedicated \"hold up flashlight\" button which also puts away your gun. This is only used for the predictable gimmick sections where they shut the lights out and you have to use the flashlight briefly to navigate. This really only happened right after the flashlight was introduced, and I basically never used it again. I chose hard mode for my first playthrough and that seems decently balanced for a first run for an experienced fps player, but I have noted some major flaws as I've progressed through the game. The first being the upgrade system.     You gain xp from killing enemies, and when you level up you get a point to unlock an upgrade from a tree with some branching choices. These range from simply gaining more health or armor to completely changing one of your guns into a different version. This is where some problems arise. Upgrade are permanent, you are locked in as soon as you select them. This would be a fine - if slightly annoying - design decision, if it weren't for the fact that these \"upgrades\" aren't always upgrades. I decided to \"upgrade\" my mp34, a reliable long range machine gun, into the grenade launcher variant. Once you have this variant, ammo for this weapon becomes extremely scarce, I found only one or two packs of 5 in very long branching levels, with multiple keys and sections. The grenade launcher must be extremely powerful right to justify this scarcity? No, not really, it's pretty weak. It has a narrow hitbox for direct hits, mediocre damage, and a very small explosion effect. A direct hit on common mid-tier enemies will result in dealing 2/3 of their health, and you only have around ~5-10 shots per level. Those kinds of enemies appear by the dozens. I could kill about 100x more enemies with the original, un-\"upgraded\" version of the weapon, as it was strong and had plentiful ammo. This is not the only example of getting locked into a downgrade either. I decided to try out the \"throwing knife\" upgrade for the basic knife. Whoops, this reduces the knife from a solid but risky fallback melee option, into what basically amounts to throwing pebbles at enemies. Throwing knives travel slowly in an arc and deal about 1/20th of mid tier enemies hp bar per hit. I'm in the middle of act 2 and I've essentially already deleted 2 weapons from my arsenal by locking myself into crappy versions with the upgrade system. Thankfully, not all the upgrades are like this (the eldritch shotgun upgrades are awesome and powerful) but for an upgrade system to be fun, investing points should always result in getting stronger or having more options to play with, not nerfing yourself. It wouldn't be so bad if you could redo your points or even unlock multiple variants, but right now getting stuck with a useless weapon for an entire playthrough is just extremely disappointing.      Unfortunately, this problem of giving the player weak tools carries over to another major aspect of the gameplay, which is the active abilities you can use every so often by racking up \"insanity points\". The list of abilities sounds cool on paper, an angelic life draining sword berserk mode, a camera flash that stuns enemies close to you, a voodoo doll that nukes in an AOE around you, and a temporary slowmo effect. These abilities should result in a cool big moment of power where you use them to turn the tide in your favor temporarily, and to an extent they are that, but they are mostly too limited to be really satisfying to use. The sword power up for instance, really suffers from the finicky hitboxes in the game. For some reason they decided that the hitbox of the sword would be exactly 1 pixel in the center of the screen that can hit exactly 1 enemy at a time and only if you're close enough for them to hit you back. The sword deals a decent amount of damage, but only restores ~10 hp per hit, and most enemies on hard mode hit for at least 20-40 damage per hit. This means that instead of resulting in a fun cool moment of slicing through hordes of enemies while stealing back health, it's actually almost never a good idea to use this power. All they would have to do to fix it would be to make it cleave across the screen instead, with a decent reach and ability to hit multiple enemies. Immediately, this power would be fun and cool to use. Similarly, the camera flash sounds decent on paper, but enemies have to be basically right next to you for it to work at all, and thus stunning enemies is rarely useful because most melee enemies are fodder and die in just a hit or two from any of the non-terrible weapons in the game. It's a flash effect right, why not just let it stun everyone looking at you? The voodoo magic explosion is fine, if a little underwhelming, and the slow-mo power is just about the only one that feels strong to use. Unfortunately, even this is hampered by the fact that you can't use any power in combination with the others! Why! Being able to slow down time to position a voodoo explosion, or go on a slow-mo rampage with the sword would actually make those powers more fun, but for some reason, you are limited to 1 at a time. Final thoughts:     It might sound like I hated played this game, but honestly, it's fine, I had some fun. It's just very frustrating that with some small tweaks like buffing some useless weapons, improving the power of the abilities and letting you use them in combination, and allowing you to respec or unlock multiple weapon variants would result in a experience that is way more fun. It's difficult to recommend this game for $20 when something like Dusk exists, but maybe if they come back and make some balance tweaks with an emphasis on improving the fun factor of some core features it wouldn't be."}, {"username": "Tamaster", "comment": "Sum-UpIn-depth analysis further down.🟩 Pros🟥 Cons- Unique visual style, that shows excellent art direction consistently.- Solid gunplay: each weapon feels diverse and fun to use.- A true but (mostly) fair challenge, even for FPS veterans, on the higher difficulty settings.- Good variety of enemies, gameplay variations and weapons to use / upgrade.- Overall solid boss design, despite some blunders.- Poor characters balance: Priest's skill-set is clearly superior to the Journalist's.- Terrible ammo economy in the latter two chapters.- The last chapter (Act 5) feels rushed, uninteresting and annoyingly-designed.- XP / leveling progression grinds to a halt further down the line.🟨 Bugs & Issues🔧 Specs- Rarely, some enemies may become invisible unintentionally.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:Took me about 11 hours to complete FMF on Hard difficulty (I admit switching to Normal in the last chapter, due to the awful ammo economy); this taking time to spot secrets and read lore files when possible. Since there's another character with four different abilities and branching skills / upgrades, this may warrant another run for some, however all the rest will stay the same. Arena-based Endless Mode is present for those interested, as well.Is it worth buying?The base price of 20€ is fair for this amount of content and quality, considering the genre. I can safely recommend purchase at full price, as the many good points overcome the blunders by a large margin.Verdict: GoodRating Chart HereA solid entry in the Old-School Shooter subgenre. Despite some flaws, it proves fun and interesting to play for the most part. Fans of shooters will like the changes it introduces, while still staying true to the genre's roots.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720285In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingPlaying as either a Journalist or Priest, players will be called to a remote town in order to investigate a series of strange events, which culminated with the disappearance of the entire city's population. This gives an incipit for our protagonist of choice to go through increasingly maddening locales, in what soon becomes a struggle for survival. In an Old School FPS, expecting an elaborate story is out of the question; regardless, there are actually a good number of documents and indirect narration elements that give out clues, tidbits about the events that went down - inspired to the Cthulhu Mythos and other supernatural cults. Despite being an unimportant requirement for this genre, the writing itself is of good quality; the same can be said for voice acting and narration - even if the voice-lines do get rather repetitive in the midst of battle, after several hours. Overall, a solid mark in this department.Combat SystemThe prime activity in FMF will be, of course, shooting heaps of cultists, mutants, abominations and everything in-between. To do so properly, you'll progressively unlock new weapons found every couple of levels, each of them using different types of ammo and having a distinct purpose on the field - although there are some redundancies. Expect an old-school feel and pacing to the gunplay, as circle-strafing and kiting enemies around while vomiting lead are the peak strategies during combat... but not always! FMF does have several levels that encourage or even force a more considerate playstyle, as they hide enemies or other hindrances behind corners, walls and such obstacles, so you can't just rush and run as you'd think. It's a nice change of pace that forces you to reconsider your approach.Both characters have four different skills; on paper, the Priest's are more defensive while the Journo's encourage aggressiveness, and this is true to an extent. Especially later on, however, the former's skills will simply prove better, as you can't really compare powerful statuses like total invincibility or infinite ammo, with a relatively miserable AoE damage or slow motion that, while useful, just don't feel as good as the holy man's feats. Such skills can be used via Madness, a mana-like stat charged by either taking or dealing damage, granting permanent charges for each ability as it increases. All feats can be upgraded to enhance their effectiveness or duration significantly, but never their core functioning. Weapons may as well be upgraded with the skill points gained by slaying enemies, with mutually-excluding patterns that transform them into significantly better - or different - murder tools. In the end there's a choice to be made between favoring better weapons or better skills, as there're not enough skill points for everything in the long run.Enemies prove varied and interesting, with each act sporting many unique variations. Some of them have weak-spots that, when hit, cause them to mutate (generally becoming weaker) and change their behavior. This rewards accuracy and know-how, but isn't really a core mechanic, as it can be done only on a handful of foes compared to the total. All enemies, on higher settings, hit like trucks while healing and ammo are sparingly found; an issue that becomes overwhelming in the last act and makes it a frustrating, unbalanced mess of bullet sponges and ill-conceived layouts.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792999356General GameplayAside from the general slaughter, you'll want to take your time in finding secrets and lore files, present in almost every level. The bounties of supplies present in hidden areas can really make the difference between a resource-starved fighter and a ready-for-anything one. With how little ammo and health there is around, especially later on, you'll soon want to become a treasure hunter, no doubt. FMF uses fixed save points in the shape of a drunken hobo, appearing once in a while to retain your progress unlimited times, but only at fixed locations. You'll also want to find color-coded keys to open doors, as it's customary in the genre.Boss FightsEach act has one boss, and all of them, except maybe one (Act 4) prove decently designed, challenging and feel unique. These powerful foes feature evolving attack patterns as they lose HP, and often spawn additional minions you gotta deal with, or soon get overwhelmed by the crossfire. It feels like latter ones are a bit too much on the bullet-spongy side, but nothing too bad in this regard. Even if multi-phased, arena-swapping in some cases, all bosses must be restarted from the start without checkpoints in case of death, which is fine.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720181Other Game ModesAfter the main story, for those who really can't get enough, endless mode is present with five unique arenas where you have to survive as long as you can with either the Journalist or Priest, against increasingly powerful foes, on a difficulty setting of your choice - while upgrading yourself and your arsenal. Completionists and achievement hunters will get into this surely, but in the end it's just \"more of the same\" without significant variations."}, {"username": "ShamblingGoatMother", "comment": "Forgive me Father because I have sinned; I purchased off a grey market site some time ago and the least I can do now is tell you that It is indeed worth it full price off steam and leave a good review.

A great example is an early map in the second episode, in a graveyard.  There are mostly low-tier zombie enemies, but lots of tall grass.  You can hear them, so you know they are present, but finding them before they get close takes effort, and you have to watch your back.-Solid weapons (all of which are useful)I find myself using every single weapon I've gotten so far.  Even the melee!  The starting pistol is weak but accurate and great for headshotting low-tier enemies to save ammo.  The only downside I'd have to say is some sound a bit weak, but not every gun can be the Super Shotgun from Doom 2.-A lot of levelsTwenty-five maps?  Feels like an old 90s shooter!  Loving the amount of levels.-Amazing Boss FightsI've faced two so far, and they break the stereotype of FPS games having lame or weak bosses.  These are masterclasses in good game design, IMO.-Great priceGame is a third the price of a AAA title and feels far more polished than one.Cons:-Some guns sound weakJust as it says.  I wish they had a bit more heft to their sound, though it's not a dealbreaker.-The Voice acting is badPerhaps they were going for old-school over the top, but it leaves a bit to be desired.  Fortunately, you can skip most of it save for the one-liners during gameplay which are tolerable.Neutral:-There's an upgrade system.Feels a bit out of place in an old-school FPS, but it's reasonably implemented, I suppose.  Even with the \"get more XP\" talents, leveling seems very slow.  I wouldn't say you even get one per level.-The story is just . . . there.Lots of \"story\" prompts around maps and beforehand exist.  I like Lovecraftian horror, but I've not been too interested in them.  It exists, is all I can really say about it.-There are two classes with recharging abilities.Another thing that seems more modern, there are two classes, one more based on offense and the other more defensive.  They have abilities that recharge as you kill enemies.  These powers are generally good and borderline essential on higher difficulties - I'd say they're well done."}, {"username": "Kal", "comment": "A dude threw a fish at me and I died.Joking aside, Forgive Me Father is a pretty good \"boomer shooter\". It just got released and needs a bit more polish to be great (notably in its tells ; the enemies make very little sound so it's hard to tell when one sneaks up on you, and there is no indicator when you take damage of the direction it came from), but it's still very enjoyable.One thing, though. The store page advertises its \"lovecraftian ambiance\". That is NOT true. A lovecraftian ambiance would mean making slow, deliberate progress while being in constant danger from incomprehensible horrors that will kill you, while being surrounded by strange secrets. In this game, you zip around at mach 3 and shoot the horrors in the face with a shotgun, turning them into fine red mist, and read a few scattered notes here and there while your character makes quip. You certainly are in a lovecraftian world, but the ambiance isn't there. This is NOT a horror game. Not at all."}, {"username": "crimsonforest", "comment": "Minimalistic, good dark music, reminiscent of Subterrain game. The menu immediately reminded me of the Darkest Dungeon production. The game quickly introduces the fight. Opponents have relatively large hitboxes which makes it easy to aim at enemies and quickly turn them into red slush. It surprised me, it seems easy with single enemies, but the level of difficulty changes dramatically when you have to deal with hordes of enemies. Here, more powerful weapons come in handy and you can choose from a large arsenal. I like the approach to the character development tree. You can choose one of two ways for each of the weapons, which encourages to repeat the production and try all available builds. The game is well optimized. It is easy to play on 12-year-old hardware.

If achievements are not a must for you, go play it- it's kind of a neat idler.P.S.- Forgot to mention that sometimes the fish you create don't show (however, that might be because I created the maximum allowed per cycle) and thus can't be fed.

Not only that, but if you use F2 to hide the game and bring it back up the issue with the fish not showing up is still there. Not to mention, they keep releasing PAID DLC for a game that barely runs. The day I downloaded I had 50 fish and the achievement STILL HASN'T POPPED. I just got the 30 fish achievements yesterday, which upped my actual total number to over 80. The main time we hear from people working on the game is right after an update when they finally answer pre-update questions, not a lot of reassurance as it seems like they're just doing it for DLC money. I started playing a day before the last update. The first day I did enough to qualify for three badges and it was days later before they showed up, and after the update the game has run significantly worse. Before it would fill my computer screen and everything rendered nicely, though the scale of the fish made it hard to actually do anything on my PC. Now, though they no longer crowd my screen, they hardly show up! I get poorly rendered bubbles at the top of my screen. They show up about 1/3 tries of rebooting and when they do show up they're blurry and pixelated, and they only hover in a box in the center of my screen. It went from mediocre to really bad in less than 100 hours. The pixelation is SO BAD now at hour 67.4 in fact that I cant even read anything in the setting to see if I can fix it myself, blindly toggling things genuinely changed nothing. I've also deleted fish and afterwards haven't been able to make new ones? I've tried taking screenshots of the issue, however it always hides the overlay so it just looks like my desktop plain.

In short, it is a creature collector JRPG with 1v1 (mostly, there are rare, but sometimes occurring 1v2 and 1v3, also I'm not taking into account PvP) turn-based battles. Coromon is, obviously, inspired by Pokemon, but if I had to say, it is inspired most of all by more older versions of Pokemon, like Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald.There are more than 100 (114 according to Corodex, however, due to specifics of some Coromon that I'll refrain from spoiling, I'd just say that there are over 100 of them) Coromon. Some have 3 stages of evolution, some just 2, nothing genre-breaking or game-redefining. There's no breeding, or different branches of evolution, so Coromon're all about just catching. There are 3 variations of each. Standard, Potent and Perfect. If you'd thought of Shinies, you are correct, as well as not.Standard Coromon appear 97.09% of the time (3101 to 3194), Potent 2.88% (92 to 3194) and Perfect 0.03% (1 to 3194). There's a Potency scale, which defines which one of the three they are. 1 to 16 Potency are Standard, 17 to 20 are Potent, and 21, which is a maximum of Potency, are Perfect. Potency defines how much XP you need before you'll receive 3 free stat points for a Coromon. The more Potency, the less XP is needed to acquire them. Basically, it's like additional level ups that go hand-in-hand with your usual XP progression. That means that unlike purely-cosmetic Shinies, Perfects can be stronger than their Standard counterparts. You may think of those free points as EV (Effort Values), even though that is not entirely true. For PvE it doesn't mean much, however if you're into that, stat changes will be noticeable and will make your creatures stronger, especially later on.There is a major flaw of this game, and it is it's oldschoolity in some of the design. I'm talking about unskippable/slow animations, strange inventory/menu management, long, unneeded transitions. I've spent 24 hours of the game for 3 first sections of it and then I've given up. I didn't want to speed up the game, but I just couldn't bear it. I've beat last 3 sections of the game in 6 hours. x4 times faster than first half of the game. And I didn't skip content, I've still collected all the Coromon, looted everything, seen the map, etc.I liked the animations, they are really awesome, as well as Coromon's visuals. However, I really don't want to spend this much time watching the same animations happen a thousand time. You cannot speed them up via game settings, skip is out of question as well. I honestly recommend getting used to the game at it's usual speed, watching those sweet attack animations and such, and when you are used to the gameplay loop and are able to respond to enemies' attacks accordingly, just speed it up. If I would've completed the same game in, let's say, 15 hours, instead of 30, I would've been really happy with it. Now, I really do grieve over so much time spent on weird management and needlessly prolonged battles. Though I still did enjoy the game.Thank you for reading, I hope you'll enjoy Coromon with or without the need to use a cheat engine or such."}, {"username": "Dust", "comment": "Playthrough in ProgressUpdate: This is not a pokemon-like game, this is a game of minigames and puzzles disguised as a pokemon-like. I would say 60%+ of the game is just doing puzzles and minigames. Not sure I'm going to bother completing it with how little and tedious the battling is compared to the amount of puzzles and minigames.None of them are particularly hard, its just really tedious.==Original Review==TLDR: Quality game, haven’t encountered any bugs and is stable so far. Has tons of feature for min-maxers for tweak their coromon. This game definitely seems aimed at those sorts rather than a chill pokemon-like game, very tedious so far.Why it’s tedious: Entirely linear, no exploration or multiple areas to train in. No secrets to be found, or side routes to be explored. Would be less of an issue if it wasn’t so grindy.Lots of puzzles – Battling often does feel like it takes a back seat to many puzzles.Excessive number of wild encounters, even when using repellent~Useful when grinding, a pain when just trying to travel. Excessive mandatory trainers blocking your paths~The equivalents of Gyms are huge and have a Gyms worth of trainers on each floor. Only thing making it bearable is I enabled regen on level up and half price shops. Otherwise I would regularly be out of items and have to backtrack to healing centers.Excessive Grinding: Even a 2-3 level difference will lead to bosses stomping your coromon, even when of an opposing type. And the excessive encounters above are still insufficient to have you at proper level by the time you reach a boss. So you’re stuck leveling in the single zones per level range."}, {"username": "JennDjinn", "comment": "Video review: https://youtu.be/4qrQbw2ENZQCoromon scratches the itch of classic Pokemon games!And while it stays true to the core gameplay,it also adds some nice features.* Great world & monster design* Challenging boss fights* About 120 Coromon* Catchy soundtrack* Loads of customization* Numerous Quality of Life features* Many different mini-games(some of which are frustrating)Turn-based combat similar to Pokemonbut with some interesting variations:* 2nd XP bar: add points to individual stats* There are standard, potent and perfect Coromon* Potent and perfect Coromon are always superior* Coromon never forget a move they learned* Each move costs SP, so there’s no PP limit"}, {"username": "IronHeaver", "comment": "I'm really glad to see more people taking a crack at the monster catching games and Coromon is a welcome breath of fresh air in a genre joined at the hip with Pokemon. As much as Id like to judge it solely on its own merits the comparison is hard to ignore but that's to be expected when competing with the largest franchise on Earth.  The Good 1. Creature Design: Coromon seems really dedicated to creating monsters that largely feel like they fit into a living breathing world, something that Pokemon seems to have less and less interest in. While I don't mind things like objectmons (Voltorb, Vanillish), I really can't stand ones that look like a Halloween costume or just set characters rather then a species of creature (Inteleon, Incineroar). Coromon's design focus leans into things that resemble functional animals for the most part with some deviations into the supernatural or technological, and its a solid design decision I hope they stick too. I should also mention that the sprite work in general is excellent. 2.Stamina as a Resource: Coromon's battle system sets it apart from pokemon while opening the door to new strategic options and potentially keeping weaker moves relevant. Its a far more engaging decision to know that spamming that powerful move could lead me to needing to skip a turn rather then just being unable to use it after 5 times. This change also effectively neuters PP stalling, while energy draining moves offer a more interesting replacement. 3. The Story: I know its a low bar but Coromon has a far more engaging main story then any recent pokemon game. Having a character that actually talks and emotes helps a fair bit in that regard as well. I wouldn't call it excellent, but its perfectly serviceable to carry you along a first time playthrough. 4. Difficulty: Coromon has a highly customisable set of difficulty options to cater to multiple playstyles and playthroughs. This is a welcome change to some of the frankly nonsensical options Pokemon has on offer like needing to beat White 2 in order to unlock easy mode or stripping away options for players to customise their experience in SWSH. In Coromon on normal difficulty the bosses and even some random trainers have put their foot down when I assumed they would be pushover fodder, while in SWSH the notion of a possible defeat never even came into my mind until the final boss. Coromon is also not afraid to get tough in some segments where it forbids you from using items or to win with just your team building knowledge. 5. Potential and Training: In Coromon shinies have an actual purpose, as being potent (semi shiny) or perfect (shiny) give them more points to spend when they level up their potential. I think the Potential system is far FAR better then EV's and IV's for customising and differentiating different Coromon. Coromon in general is leagues more transparent in your teams actual stats and how you can influence those stats to build your ideal team. Coromon is also much more generous with ways to both find/create more potent coromon, as well as levelling them up quickly throughout the game. My only gripe with this is that at times I felt like I was somewhat missing out when I settled for a standard mon, although standard mons are perfectly capable of taking on the games challenges.6. Traits: Coromon is also a lot more liberal with the passive abilities it puts at your disposal. While I liked the idea behind hidden abilities in Pokemon, when certain pokemon require their hidden abilities to work it can quickly turn into a slog trying to get your ideal fighter. None of that here, not only do some coromon have access to 4 abilities no strings attached, you can also reroll abilities fairly early in the game. I also like the idea of biome specific traits, it keeps the spirit of hidden abilities while being more accessible and adding flavor to the world. The Bad 1. Evasion and Accuracy: You remember how annoying it was to get sand attack spammed at you by a pidgy? Or when a trainer used double team over and over? Well there's a fair bit of that in Coromon, and its just as frustrating here as it is in Pokemon. While it makes sense that kicking up a sandstorm would make it harder to land an attack turning a 100% accuracy move into a dice roll just isn't a fun mechanic. If they were really set on keeping the effects personally I would add something like X-Com's graze effect, where you have a chance to mitigate the attack rather then completely negate it. Maybe if your opponent has lowered accuracy and you have heightened evasion you could still succeed in completely negating the attack but it requires more investment. Powerful moves having a chance to miss is a good trade off, but when my opponent can turn every move into a roulette I believe the gameplay suffers.2. Animation Length: While I mentioned earlier that the sprite work is by and large excellent, and that holds true for the move effects, some effects seem to take up more time then necessary and when your using them often this can become annoying. This is especially true for some multi hit moves like Heated Horns which have the attack animation play out multiple times for each successful strike. This is in sharp contrast to a move like Multi Bolt which fires off all its successful blasts in lightning (heh) quick fashion. This is more of a nitpick then any deal breaking issue but I don't think it would hurt to trim down some of the animations to keep battles moving along. 3. Linearity: In general the world of Coromon is explored in a mostly straight line. This is something of a slump mainline pokemon games have found themselves in as well. While there are some goodies and quests to find off the beaten path you're going to be on a tight leash as far as the major areas are concerned. Again nothing of a deal breaker but Id love to see a more open world design from this series in the future. 4. Audio Nitpicks: Having nearly every Coromon's cry being its name like Pokemon do in the show was an ambitions choice. For the most part I think they did a good job with shortening/changing/distorting the cry so it sounds more like a creature then a person, but there are a few examples (looking at you Kyraptor) where it definitely feels forced. Coromon having a defeated cry would also would be nice but that's more of a wishlist sort of thing. My other issue with the audio is that certain moves like Poison Sting are way louder then others for some reason. This could be an issue with my machine but I'm honestly not sure. 5. No Trading or Co-op: Trading is something the entire potential and traits system seems to be begging for, and to their credit TRAGsoft has expressed interest in adding it. At time of writing its still absent and is sorrily missed, I got 2 potent Purrgy's and wish I could give one to my friend who is also enjoying the game. Co-op is admittedly a big ask, but it was the highlight for me when playing SWSH. I would also feel a lot better about recommending Coromon to other friends if we had a way to play together that wasn't direct PvP. Maybe remixed Titan battles with friends?6. Bugs: This game still has a few bugs, but the devs are putting out patches to fix them so this is more of an acknowledgement then a complaint. I haven't experienced anything especially disruptive or game breaking but if the notion of bugs is a no deal for you then maybe give it a bit more time.  Final Thoughts Overall Iv really enjoyed my time with Coromon and its great to see a smaller studio make improvements on a formula that the mainstream has gotten a bit too comfortable with (a comparison to Stardew Valley comes to mind). It has a lot of replay value with its customizable difficulty and I can definitely see myself replaying it in the future. I think Coromon is setting off on the right foot and while it has some room to grow I look forward to what it has in store for the future."}, {"username": "FunkMasterChunk", "comment": "I've been loving Coromon.

The game is also more engaging as it's a lot more challenging than Pokémon. Status ailments and stat debuffs are actually really useful and the general balance of types seems to be a lot better. There are also different difficulty levels and even optional Nuzlocke functions (but don't bother using those on your first playthrough or you're going to have a bad time).

It captures the magic of the original Pokemon games while thankfully ramping up the difficulty. Sadly there are only 116 Coromon, but the game is diverse enough that it doesnt hold it back too much. The potential system allows you to choose stats for your Coromon which to me is a game changer. It means no two Coromon will ever be the same and no more hidden values like in Pokemon, as this basically lets you choose those values.There are public and private multiplayer options which allows you to compete to be the very best!

The difficulty scales up rapidly when you reach end game making most customization of characters not viable.  They cap your level at 60 so you cant grind your way to victory either.  The end game bosses can only be done with a few specific party builds.  Now this is not necessarily bad but can be a bit of a turn off for some.  Personally I like being able to grind my way to being over powered in RPGs but to each there own.If this was all though I wouldn't be leaving this negative review.  The biggest problem is that some end game areas are locked behind being able to win some extremely difficult and over-tuned racing minigame, repeatedly.  From what I've read online all the best armors are locked behind this as well as some end game dungeons.  I have no idea what was going through the Dev's minds when they made this ridiculous racing minigame a requirement."}, {"username": "Grammel", "comment": "Alright, so I probably have a little bit left of the game, but I figured I'd take the time to review it now.The number one reason to get this game is, I think, that the exploration is great. There are hidden nooks and crannies everywhere, some with some new item or a shortcut between zones, other with whole brand new zones. Real sense of curiosity in figuring out what's around the next corner, very rewarding to follow your nose. The platforming isn't great, but I think it's a means to an end. Once you understand the tools in your kit, you start seeing all these parts of the level that you could fineagle on up to. Further, there's a little bit of metroidvania in here with unlocking new modes of transport. Only problem with that is that it requires a second or two of menuing in order to access those modes, which can add up.The JRPG stuff is pretty good too. Might not be the best ever, but it's more than solid. Fair few moments where I felt rewarded for my build choices, though in the back half there have been a lot more times where I felt I was just scraping by, even from standard encounters. But it's possible I missed an area, or my builds aren't as good as I thought. If you hate JRPGs, this one is not going to change your mind. Again, though, if you can look past that part, I think you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised.Presentation is mostly serviceable. The graphics do what they need to for the most part, though some of the enemy sprites are good. There were a couple moments where the camera didn't play along, but those didn't feel intentional. The music is mostly good too. There are a couple tracks that are real bangers, there is one track for a later game dungeon which I hate, with most falling in the okay bracket.The story isn't very good. The main thrust with crystals and the grand master feels like the creator has something to say about games and game design, but it's felt too heavy handed. Even if it didn't it's very simplistic. Though the exploration is fantastic, I haven't really found any lore. There are recurring characters which are kind of fun, but your mileage might vary.  Whatever narrative value I've gotten out of this game has been my own mind filling in the blanks of the world or imagining the interactions of my characters.All in all, the game isn't the best thing ever put out, but it's very good. More importantly it's almost unbeatable at this price, and offers a fairly comprehensive demo. The developer is also apparently fairly attentive, as there has been a steady roll of bugfixes and minor changes since release. I am very excited to see what they do in the future."}, {"username": "LunaticWoda", "comment": "Pros:Many job classesDeep gameplayTONS of explorationChallengingTook me 50+ hours to beat the game but not all content....ConsStory super lacking but its a 1 man dev so ill grade this on a curvethe lack of guidance can be frustrating AT timesCasuals may get overly frustrated with the level of challangeOverall FANTASTIC gem of a game at 15 bucks this thing is a STEAL dude should charge more for house complex he made this game.

The idea of exploration with tactics-like (VERY tactics-like) growth system is fantastic.  All numbers are given to you to understand how and why things happen.

The exploration is fun... until you continual lose anywhere between 5 mins to 30 minutes of doing nothing but jump-jump-jump and about 57 jumps in... OOPS that one wasn't perfect because I had to guess against the specifically designed optical illusion.  I jumped straight but I guess that one was one tile higher and no way to see that.  Lots of time lost.... again....I don't mind parkour games.  But there is a reason why people who enjoy playing number games don't really enjoy having all their time wasted with a single \"Fail at 99% and lose over 30 minutes of progress\".  I desperately want to recommend this game since to dev came so close to glory.Unfortunately, the ridiculous parkour, gimmicky battles, and frankly just vulgar tone of the dev in this game makes it a no go for me.  Don't waste your money because by the time you realize you haven't hit the \"Real game\" yet, you've spent more than 2 hours getting there thinking this feels fun.  Its not.

Having tanking classes and threat mechanics is ultimately pointless when your tank has to spend their turns with threat-generating skills, which means they aren't using their defensive buffs & debuffs, which means they get one-shotted.By the end the message falls pretty flat when the game stops being about freedom and exploration because every fight turns into a puzzle which forces one specific party build as the only functional solution."}, {"username": "Necroma Crowley", "comment": "Very addictive game and from what I can tell, there's not been a single bug anywhere.Pros: -Made with love-No Bugs-A E S T H E T I C S-Keeps you on your toes-For masochitsCons:-Can be difficult at times-Whoever thought that adding \"jumping puzzles\" and \"stopwatch\" type of events to a Pixel 3D JRPG with relatively jank-y controls was a good idea, deserves a special spot in hell, right next to the original inventor of the former.-Bad for people with anxiety-For masochsts"}, {"username": "Iron Brew", "comment": "Game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece.

I've almost 100%'d the game with about 80 hours put into it, and now I'm feeling rather sad about that.For one, it's probably the first JRPG in a long time where I felt that I was actually exploring in the overworld, not just walking on a pretty static background. The platforming may be grating to some people, and it took some time for me to get used to it, but I think it really adds to the exploration feel of the game. There are a few jumps in the critical path that should be adjusted, though, but I trust the developer will get to addressing those in time. No loading screens anywhere outside of loading a save file is a nice touch too.The combat has consistently kept me on my toes for the whole game. The threat system and the ability to see your enemy's skill list and next upcoming action heavily rewards counter/preventative tactics rather than the reactive gameplay that I'd utilize in the majority of other traditional turn-based games.Status effects are extremely useful and not prone to RNG like most other games, like how Blind guarantees that all physical attacks used by an enemy during their next turn will miss, which means it's one turn where you don't need to worry about healing whichever party member they're targeting (or an extra turn to do so). Landing those status effects is usually guaranteed chance, though some like Sleep have a once per battle limitation. The vast majority of enemies do not have status immunities of any sort, so all status effects are just as effective on enemy encounters as they are against the party, a concept that is almost unheard of in most JRPGs.Granted, late game enemies seem very deadly, and this doesn't change after you reach the level cap. There is no out-leveling the endgame here. From what I've observed, if you are unable to one-round an endgame regular encounter, the balance seems to assume that you have a source of attack/magic down on the enemy or defense buffs on your party.Some say this makes the late combat very deadly and swingy, but at the same time hitting the level cap right as you reach the endgame also means you aren't really supposed to try to murderhobo everything you see past that point (nor is there much of an incentive to, beyond looking for gold or grinding up job levels, the latter of which can be done against much easier enemies specifically for that purpose earlier in the game). Most encounters are avoidable, and you are a party of regular ass explorers, not some chosen ones with an excuse to kill something.I had a bit of trouble adjusting to the expectations of this game's endgame balance at first since I couldn't just steamroll everything just because I was max level, but I've since reconciled with the idea that this actually contributes heavily to the game's overall exploration feel too. Granted, there are some things off with the game's balance, particularly how certain tools are locked to very specific class setups, but I imagine the developer will address those with time.The soundtrack is phenomenal. They're all apparently royalty free music that's properly attributed to their creators, and the collection within this game matches each environment and situation perfectly. I find myself frequently going into the game's archive function just to listen to them.The story kind of barely exists, and the developer has been openly saying that if what you value is an epic plot above all else, this game probably isn't for you. It's really more for the gameplay > story crowd. There are a few things that could still be improved in regards to the overall progression and writing, though. Expect to get lost at times, only to find another means to progress at a different part of the game world.All in all, this game is definitely worth much more than its low price. At the very least, I can guarantee there's no other JRPG like it as of the time this review was written.

It will not be for everyone. It does not focus on narrative. You may get lost or frustrated, or killed by an endgame boss you discovered in a secret area long before you're ready to fight it.But there's almost no other RPG like this out there, and so far it's everything I never knew I wanted.

I was really looking forward to playing this. I love the creative team behind this game, I love the concept of supernatural wild west, and I love immersive sim RPGs. Unfortunately the game developers missed the mark on this one. PROS:- This game has a lot of style. The UI elements, environments, and characters all have unique distinctive designs and does a good job of immersing you into the Weird West. - When the combat works it can be a lot of fun. When you've sneaked and set up a trap and used the games mechanics to pull of crazy stuff it feels great! Unfortunately that is all the praise I have to say for the game. CONS:- The combat the majority of the time is clunky and not very intuitive. I don't really know if the isometric style of gameplay really works with real time stealth and shooting mechanics. Most the time I felt I was fumbling around with the controls. Being 6 hours in and each of the characters having the same control scheme I should not still be fumbling with them. - If there is 1 word I'd say for the combat loop it would be repetitive, it feels like the only real \"Immersive sim\" things they added to the game are kick a barrel and watch it blow up. It sure is fun, but boy it gets old after a while. The game never feels like it encourages me to use any other method other than blow up a barrel or just shoot them. - There is no diversity in the multiple characters. The Bounty Hunter plays exactly the same as The Pigman. Why would a Pigman use a gun?!?!?! Each character should feel distinct from one another and offer gameplay advantages and new scenarios that the other ones can't. You never end up using their special abilities because I hardly ever have mana to do so! And when I do I just die immediately because I am right in the open getting shot by 4 dudes. - The story is not really worth mentioning. Its very boring and doesn't really utilize the Weird West setting at all. Also no voice acting is really crappy. I get its expensive and this is a new smaller studio, but $40 is $40 I should get voice acting for that. Plenty of other indie games have it and are far cheaper. Scale back the dialog if this can't be done.All in all, I think this is a profoundly disappointing experience. Its such a shame because all the pieces are there to make a great game and they just couldn't bring it together. I hope this studio continues to make games, because immersive sims are something of a rarity in these days and I'd like to see them take another shot at it. For now I would not recommend Weird West."}, {"username": "zincowl", "comment": "Aside from few unique selling points that it desperately tries to make you aware of in its tutorials along with somewhat misleading claims to the ever shifting concept of an \"immersive sim\", Weird West is by all accounts a small version of a Bethesda game with familiar genre trappings, albeit more morally unhinged in its story and characters. It has a moderately reactive open world consisting of nearly identical larger towns and small settlements spread out across a map while the main crux of its RPG routine is picking up everything in sight in the fashion of a mole or a vacuum cleaner with the goal of selling it to vendors or crafting. Surprisingly, however, what this game also offers is a mildly satisfying twin-stick shooter with bullet-time, although it is once again undercut by resource based systems that never let the player fully explore neither their arsenal nor the character skills. All the while the tactical aspect of the fights can only be expanded upon through hiring AI companions that expectedly work as distracting cannon fodder, taking away any desire for active participation.What remains is the freedom of approach, which this game reduced mainly to the freedom of who and how to kill. This becomes evident immediately after opening the skill and perk menus that offer to exclusively amplify repetitive exploration activities and weapon handling through gradual percentage increases. This limp fixation on loot and combat continually haunts all 5 available characters all of which are barely distinguishable between one another, which means that even if this game didn't try to sacrifice gameplay variety to serve the story structure by taking the player through their stories in a continuous manner, this variety would still remain barely noticable.All of the above-mentioned observations make the whole experience seem like a confused venn-diagram with Weird West sitting somewhere at the cross-section of \"poor content variety\", \"tired RPG cliches\", \"unrewarding progression\", and \"mediocre shooter\". Makes me wonder what all those big action rpgs would be worth without the pretty views and music they spend so much time and resources on.You know you're in for a treat when you see a \"junk\" section in a game inventory.

It's also very easy to find weapons that are better than anything you can craft yourself so picking up anything else than healthkits and dynamite is pretty pointless and the constant inventory management if you pick up junk feels like a waste when it only serves to get you more bullets. As soon as I restarted with the second character I lost the will to do any sidequests or exploration because you keep losing all your stuff.The game feels like it has some cool ideas but it's just half-cooked and after a couple hours you start seeing through the mechanics.

It's an extremely rare honor for a mod to be allowed onto Steam as a standalone product and it's a testament to the quality and polish we all have placed onto this mod.I've been playing Downfall on the workshop for dozens if not hundreds of hours, and I can assure you it is a quality product that more than triples the amount of content you get out of the base game. We hope that you will enjoy the hard work we have put into this.If you want more out of the modding community, absolutely check out the workshop! We are but a tiny fraction of the thousands of wonderful mods available for this game. We have placed a link and a guide inside the game if you want to broaden your horizons further, and we hope more than anything that this is a stepping stone into a whole new world in your Spire slaying career.Have fun, and good luck,blalo'u"}, {"username": "Pika22", "comment": "Downfall is an extension of Slay the Spire which effectively triples the existing game's content without any trace of lost quality within its mechanics. Above all, the game feels like a love letter to StS, retaining the appeal of the existing game while introducing new concepts that are built around the game's system and mechanics. With EIGHT new characters to try, each with a full card set and another Ascension ladder to climb, Downfall is not going to bore you anytime soon. - Hermit is a cursed gunslinger who revolves (pun intended) around Dead On cards, which gain extra effects when in the center of your hand. He can also take advantage of curses and even debuffs for extra versatility. - Slime Boss, more of a setup-based character, can Split into various types of slimes which have effects at start of turn. Overflowing on slimes gives you 1 Strength, making a slime spam strategy very tantalizing. Slime Boss can also stack on large amounts of Goop to deal ridiculous damage with one attack. - Guardian is more defensive, and essentially is Body Slam Ironclad on steroids. With easily available Block and Barricade and incredible cheese potential, you're going to have a lot of fun taking zero damage. - Hexaghost has a set of Ghostflames which trigger their effects after a certain condition is met, such as playing two Attacks. Adding to this is a new Afterlife keyword which lets you play a card as it's Exhausted, plus a new Poison-like status called Soulburn which deals insane damage after 3 turns. - Champ is basically Watcher for people who don't like taking 30+ damage after miscalculating their turn. While his Stances do nothing on their own, some of his cards have a Technique keyword, with varying effects depending on which Stance you're in. - My personal favorite, Automaton can Encode various cards into its Sequence, temporarily removing them from its deck cycle. Once 3 cards are in the Sequence, they're combined into one Function with the effects of all 3 cards. You don't need me to tell you how ridiculous this can get. - Gremlins consists of 5 different characters, who you can switch between with various cards. They each have a passive effect which can shape your deck, but make sure the Gremlin you're focusing on doesn't die. - Since no StS mod would be complete without a meme character, Snecko revolves around luck. Lots and lots of luck. Central to its mechanics are Unknown cards, which turn into random cards that satisfy a certain condition at the start of combat - including cards of a different class. Good luck.Adding to this incredible amount of content is the new Downfall mode, which essentially rewrites how an StS run is expected to go, mostly in ways that are best experienced blind. One of the more interesting changes in my opinion is the map - in Downfall, you start at the top of the map and travel down, with the boss at the bottom. However, the map's procedural generation isn't modified to take this into account, meaning that you will start each Act with a campfire, and there will likely be multiple enemy fights right before the boss. This makes boss fights, especially early bosses, much more stressful, as you might not be entering with full health.Overall, I highly recommend Downfall to anyone who is even mildly interested in more Slay the Spire content."}]}, {"game_id": "1485080", "game_title": "Just_Act_Natural", "reviews": [{"username": "Boethiah", "comment": "Fun"}, {"username": "DOGCLOPS", "comment": "This is my favorite hide and seek game, It is tons of fun with friends or in public lobbies.

It is quite simply one of the best maps I've ever seen in a videogame.But that's where the good things end. This is a game entirely carried by its environment. The combat is underdeveloped and gets dull quickly, there's barely any enemy variety, the open world activities are basically a bunch of ubisoft tier collectathons, and the story feels like a complete afterthought with how uninteresting it is.It feels like what happened here is that they made the map and then realized they had to make a game around it, so they scrambled to fill it up with content and shipped it as soon as possible. This is a rushed product, not in the usual sense of being buggy, but in the sense that its core concepts haven't been developed enough.I'd love to see Ghostwire becoming a series that takes us to different places across the world with their local environment und culture on display, but before that can happen, Tango Gameworks has to sit down and rework the mechanics of Ghostwire. Make the combat deep and engaging beyond some sparkly animations. Give us a great range of different enemies that we actually have to approach differently from each other. Invest time into making a compelling story with interesting characters. And make open-world content that makes the exploration of your beautiful worlds even more fun rather than less so. Ghostwire has alot of potential and can become a great game series, but as it currently stands it's not there yet.

It focuses around Japanese folklore, which normally I don't care about, but it makes each new discovery interesting.  It then adds on a huge amount of collectibles of various types, randomly hidden all throughout the city, which improve your character in some way - which can be discouraging for some, but I found it engagingUnfortunately, that's part of the problem; I did a lot of the sidequests, and collected a lot of things.  I'm now 8 hours in and have fully upgraded all my combat abilities, and I don't think there's really anywhere left to go.  This is what combat is going to be like for the next 30 hours or so.  Which is sorta fine, because it's still enjoyable, but I'm not sure it will be enjoyable 30 hours later.  Otherwise, many of the quests are also very hollow; they exist only to show you some creature from folklore, and then you hold down the 'absorb power' button and it dies and you get a reward.The rewards also stop feeling rewarding when you see that after 8 hours of meticulously grabbing every one you find, you're at 20,000/250,000 And speaking of finding things - you get an ability with no cooldown, that lets you see any interactable object, or enemy, through walls in any direction, for quite a long distance.  This makes the collectible business trivial and tedious; every few steps you stop, press the hotkey, look around/up/down/everywhere, try to figure out if any of the dozen outlines currently being shown are anything useful, move forward a few more steps, repeatSo, it's a maybe for me.  I still plan to keep going with it, and just avoid/ignore the collectibles, and see how it all plays out.  And on its surface, it really does look and feel great.

I also enjoyed the flavour text and reading all the descriptions and KK Notes in full. I know this can be boring and tedious to some people but that's why if you want to not bother with it, you can just play through the story. The story is of a mad scientist and his efforts into separating the soul from the body  but focused around a young man fused with a ghost who was one such soul separating from his body. They team up to kick ass and reverse the separation and put everyone back into their bodies. It's a very quick story to get through and the ending got me super emotional. Tears lined my face I tell ya! I would be interested in a sequel of sorts to see if Akito (young man protagonist) continues to vanquish otherwordly foes or help those with spirit problems. Definitely room to expand the world or leave it as it is.I think it's a lovely game for sure. It balances campy with grit very nicely but won't be a game for everyone.

Catch it on sale."}, {"username": "Solid Gamer", "comment": "★☆☆☆☆ TerribleFar Cry 2: TokyoThis is without a doubt the most disappointing game I've played this year.First off, I went into this game with the perfect mindset. There is so much wrong in this game that I can't understand how someone could give this high ratings. There is not a single pinch of love put into this game that I can feel. It feels like the only person that really wanted to make the game was Ikumi Nakamura (the ex creative director of the game) and when she left, the other devs were forced to finish this game which created this cesspool of a video game.When I saw the combat through the gameplay trailers, I was excited. It looks great and the animations are badass then I saw the amount of elements and I was like \"Wow, can't wait to see what other badass attacks I can throw at my enemies\". The fact that there are only 3 elements and each of them only has 2 attacks, light and heavy. THAT IS IT. For a 10 hours game, this is pathetic. The skill tree is a joke. Even with there being only 3 elements, I was still somewhat optimistic. The upgrades are boring and dreadful. \"Increase the width of your water element attack from 1m to 2m\". There's also nothing for the melee department. There isn't anything like summoning a fire sword that you can use against enemies. This is creatively bankrupt and it shocks me that the man who made this studio was Shinji Mikami. It is embarrassing that his name is now put into this game.The combat also doesn't improve with the poor array of enemy types. The enemies have cool designs even tho most of them look identical. The way their attacks are choreographed are all quite different. The flaw here is that 95% of enemies require the same way to kill which is by spamming everything you have at it. Only one enemy that actually forced me to change elements and that is the fat shield guys because you gotta use the water elements since it's like shotgun. This just makes combat way more bland than it already is. This world is the definition of empty. The map screen is so cluttered with icons: there are telephone booths everywhere in this game, why did the developers have the need to place all of them on the map screen? Same goes for the flying demons. They felt like they need to show everything on the map, no matter how badly it effects the experience as a whole.The worst aspects of this open world is definitely collecting spirits. There are a total of 240000 spirits you need to collect (probably 35-40 hours of all game). How do you collect spirits you may ask? Well, you hold the right mouse button. You do this for every single spirit you find. And then there's the side quest which I gave them a chance. In this game, you talk to random souls that all have the exact same design. There is absolutely no way for anyone to be interested in whatever is happening to these people.95% of buildings in this game you can not enter and when there are, it is stopped by a loading screen and you're teleported into the building. What year is this? Am I back in 2012? Even Yakuza Kiwami fixed this problem long ago. What a joke.Story: the most generic anime plot to ever exist. Blank protagonist who cares for his blank of a sister who is working with a blank detective to save Tokyo from a blank villain. That's the best way I can put this story. The acting is also weak, the amount of overacting in this one is hilarious and no scene will even touch your emotions.Ghostwire: Tokyo the only way to describe the game comes in mind = colossal disappointment!"}, {"username": "zuppaclub", "comment": "main story is too short ( chapter 5 and 6 are just like a breeze, 1 small area, bosses and cutscenes ), do not ride the bike if you still want finding collectibles, etc.film grain effect must be remove or add on off toggle, it makes the graphics looks bad ( I remove it via file edit thanks to one of user post , you could check it on discussion )jumping from the building, trying to gliding , many times makes me want to punch my monitor, I press jump, it won't jump and I fall down from the building, it's like a delay responseI like small details, like if you near collectible, there is a meow sound, or when some of type of enemy near you, for example scrissor lady, the building or environment near you will changed to red mess.I really like bosses design and attack pattern, even though their human design are forgetable except the hannya mask one.I hope there will be a prequel / sequel / expansion DLClong story short, it's ubisoft open world type of game, which I loved it."}]}, {"game_id": "1239320", "game_title": "Animal_Shelter", "reviews": [{"username": "Preator", "comment": "IntroductionAnimal Shelter is a first-person perspective simulator with the primary goal of operating and maintaining an animal shelter that rescues cats and dogs, and allows you to find them new homes. 🟩 Positives 🟥 Negatives 🟩 Relaxing gameplay.🟩 A moderate quantity of dog and cat breeds to look after.🟩 Your facility is simply modular, allowing you to choose where rooms are placed.🟩 Finding animals a good home is emotionally rewarding.  🟥 Ugly animal models.🟥 Lack of any storyline basically ensures you have no goals to work toward.🟥 The gameplay loop is exceptionally repetitive, with very little to bolster your experience in terms of activities.🟥 Limited customisation.🟥 Animal behaviours don't offer you any varying challenge at all.StoryTo my great dismay, there isn't one. You own and operate an animal shelter that you can personally name, but there isn't any information about your character's motivations for opening one or why they choose to rescue only dogs and cats, and not any other types of animals.Gameplay AnalysisEvery dog (and cat) has its day.The gameplay elements that are present are exceptionally clean and well-thought-out. Unfortunately, the clear downfall is that there aren't many of them. You will begin the game following a rather basic tutorial of how things work: ordering food and water, buying cleaning utensils, taking pictures of the pet, playing with, and looking after them, etc. All of this with the expectation that they will become happier and healthier and eventually be ready to go to a good home that you have personally selected.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790210259Once you have fare-welled your first animal (be they a cat or dog, as you get the choice at the beginning), you expect the game to open up and provide you with some kind-of fleshed-out experience with plenty of progression and customisation. And that is where the game loses any traction as there is nothing more to it. The only decent addition is that you get limited control over how the shelter will expand, but that's more like fluff content than anything substantial to challenge you, as the customisation of the facility is extremely basic. These upgrades only really serve to make your more gruelling tasks a lot easier and don't add any more things to manage.The only major aspect that I thought might provide some variance to the otherwise stale loop was the animal behaviours, where some are energetic, some are aggressive, and so on. It was seemingly a forgotten mechanic as it doesn't play any part in looking after the pet at all. Every animal you take in will have the same generic AI and doesn't change in the slightest during the entire playtime. The only thing this does for you is that it helps you choose the type of home it should go to, and that is it.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790210577Audio and VisualFrom a visual standpoint, Animal Shelter has a lot going for it. The environments are detailed and engaging, and the surrounding nature is eye-catching, with lush and highly-detailed foliage decorating the horizon in all directions. And then you go to your loving new companion, and they look like someone glued fur to a pig hoping to trick you into rescuing it. It is such an ordeal, that something as simple as trying to get a decent photo of them for the website is a nightmare all on its own.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790210441The audio isn't a whole lot better. A bland and flavourless soundboard has been used here with a limited scope of variance. All the dogs sound the same, and all the animation effects sound recycled and empty of any real depth. You get the immediate impression that they weren't recorded for a simulation-style experience. The soundtrack is perhaps the only positive aspect here, as it is soothing and provides you with a tranquil experience as you potter around doing whatever you plan to do for the day.PC Performance and SpecificationsWith the game set to the highest possible settings, I never noticed the framerate drop below 60. There was a surprisingly limited quantity of bugs and glitches during this experience, but I did have at least two crashes in the frame of approximately 5 hours.🟧 Graphical quality is mediocre even at the highest setting.🟨 A couple of early crashes made it hard to want to invest time.RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 34%)CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 37%)GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 40.4%)Final Thoughts - BorderlineReview chart here.Animal Shelter isn't going to win any awards for simulator of the year, that's for sure. But the overall experience isn't terrible, it lacks any significant graphical polish or gameplay mechanic that will help break the monotonous loop, but it is a very soothing experience that gives a good insight into what it's like to work in a real animal shelter. I think this game would benefit from some kind-of customisation and varying gameplay, but at the moment, it just doesn't support it.I cannot recommend buying this game at full price, as it simply isn't a full game (yet?). I can, however, happily recommend it to an animal lover who can find it at a severe discount.Follow our Curator page,  Summit Reviews  , to see more high-quality reviews regularly."}, {"username": "Dantor", "comment": "Sadly, I can only give this game a negative review. As much as I admire the good intentions in this game, it is unfortunately absolutely inadequately created.It starts with the fact that you don't get to see any people in this game. The interaction with the new pet owners is only done via the PC. And there you spend a lot of time, if you really want to find the right new owner. A lot of time!Normally the interactions with the animals are limited to feeding, giving water, petting or throwing the ball, waiting for the poop to be made and washing. Especially with the dogs being pack animals, I would have expected them to play with each other if you let them out in the run together - but nothing. The dogs also do not lie down in their dog beds so far.... well, it's daytime all the time anyway. Oh, and there is of course no daily routine, so fixed feeding times, for example. For sick, malnourished or too fat animals can be important.And my biggest criticism: You have to do everything alone! There is no support, no employees, no volunteers to walk the dogs, as is usual at least in local animal shelters (Germany). There are also no visitors, no adoption events like some shelters like to host.The game is really very repetitive: animal arrives, take care of it in the cage, have a short time outdoor, take a picture, place an ad, find a suitable owner, put the dog in the car - and the next one.In short, it gets boring quickly.There are many tasks in an animal shelter that you can do yourself and also delegate to others.

I'd say to think carefully.It's hellacute for the first half hour, but soon becomes tiresome and repetitive. You're basically a one man band, you have to do everything yourself without the ability to employ staff/volunteers to aid you. You can only adopt one animal at a time. Your day consists of living on a computer to either find information/shop/build. All animals are recolours of the same dog/cat, over and over.The game is a constant repetition of : Find animal>feed animal>pat animal>throw ball/play with laser> clean up poop> take photo> scan photo> place ad> find suitable match (this takes an AGE)> handover animal. Rinse and repeat. Over and over and over and over again. You may get the odd illness or wash thrown in, but that's about it.Not sure if its a bug for everyone, but I have found that you don't always receive everything you have purchased once you 'take all' from the delivery box and should you move any of your buildings, you find the majority of your stuff has gone missing and has to be repurchased. I've also found that the game freezes intermittently while carrying animals.I don't want to be too harsh on it, I've played much much worse and I do think that there is definitely a market for older children/young teens here, but i'd be inclined to say that you can actually have more fun playing sims pets than this.

On the other hand, Animal Shelter overflows with wholesome vibes only. It was a completely different experience from the usual bloodshed & slaughter games. This game was very exciting to play at first. But after the game shows you all its trump cards, it starts becoming repetitive & boring. Well, at least for me it did. You might have a completely different take on this game! It was nice to see the developers donating 10 grand from their income to animal shelters in real life! My hope for humanity is restored.About This Game Storyline There’s no storyline for the game. You just have objectives to achieve. You take in dogs/cats, tend to them then put them up for adoption. You just have to repeat this over & over again. Yes, there is variety in the dogs & cats since they have different characteristics & varying needs & wants. But the core gameplay feels very repetitive.Gameplay Mechanics I am sure you guys would've played at least one of those “Simulator” games. Well, if you didn’t, lemme explain it a bit. These games try to replicate the experience of a particular job in most cases. For instance, this game gives the player insight into how it feels to own an Animal Shelter. It might not be very accurate but it covers the basics. When you start this game, you get thrown into a tutorial. This lasts for a long time as the game has a lot of features. The game goes something like this: You have to first choose what animal you want to start with; A dog or a cat.  After choosing, you spawn into the game’s world. A van brings in your first stray animal.  Each animal you get has different characteristics & varying needs & wants. As an Animal Shelter, you have to tend to these needs & wants to make the animal happy.  These may include food, water, medical attention, clean up, playing with it, etc. Catering to these needs will improve the dog’s physical & mental health allowing you to put it up for adoption.  You need to buy a camera to take pictures of the dogs which will then be uploaded along with the advert for its adoption. After uploading the Advertisement, you play the waiting game waiting for the perfect client to adopt the dog. This is decided by comparing the traits & features of both, the dog & the client. The more they have in common, the more reputation points you get. You can send a person from your animal shelter to go & investigate the client for more information.  Through the computer, you can choose each animal you want to take in. After selecting, the same blue van will come & deliver the pets to you.  Then the game basically repeats these steps.So, that’s basically how you play the game. It’s repetitive after a while but you can never get enough of these fluffy animals! The interactions are very cute. You can play with the animals & even pet them. What surprised me is that you can pet the animal after placing it in the van which will take them to the new owner. It’s a very emotional detail if you get emotionally attached to one of the pets. Some animals you get will either have an injury or will be sick. You can treat them at the med bay if they are injured. If they are sick, you have to take a blood sample & submit it to the Vet who will send you a prescription of what you need to use to heal that animal. Money management is very important. It’s best to buy supplies whenever you need them since the drone delivers them in 10 seconds. I really love how they used drones to deliver stuff in disposable cardboard boxes which can also be used as storage for extra stuff. You can get expansion tickets by earning reputation stars. These tickets can be used to expand the area of your animal shelter, allowing you to build more buildings. You will need more dog & cat enclosures if you are going to be taking in a lot of them!See, there are a lot of things you can do but the game still gets stale after the tutorial. There are also a few bugs you will encounter like disappearing items, animals clipping through walls, etc. Some mechanics like picking up the animals, the dogs chasing the ball, etc feel a bit too janky. I am sure they will slowly rectify all the bugs & glitches the game has!Visuals & AudioThe visuals aren’t that appealing but animals look cute in any resolution! The game feels low poly. The animations of the animals are very cute! I love how the dogs react when petting them & how the cats chase the lasers. What’s really appealing is the usage of drawings of cute dogs & cats on the loading screen & a drawing of a sad cat & dog in the pause menu with a speech bubble that has “YOU GOIN’, FREN?”. It’s so cute & sad at the same time. Doesn’t allow me to exit the game, hence why I just Alt-F4. In conclusion, the game's visuals are not that great & could use some polishing. On the other hand, their UI design is pretty eye-catching.I forgot to mention that the game gives pretty low FPS. I guess the developers haven’t properly optimized the game. It overheats my laptop & has a lot of FPS drops. Please look into this!Sound design, there’s nothing much apart from Background music, animals barking or meowing, the honk of the van & the whirring of the blades of the Quadcopter. All of them have been perfectly implemented!Pros Cute animals. I love the animations that the dogs & cats have. They’re just adorable. A lot of content. The game is endless. It’s a bit detailed as it takes into account the basic needs of the animals.  The graphics are decent. The animals look low poly when compared to the other hard surface assets, but they oddly suit the game’s vibes. Cons Gameplay gets repetitive & stale real quick.  Few bugs & glitches, no game is perfect.ConclusionI needed a cute & wholesome break and this game gave that to me. I honestly had fun while playing it although I got bored of it. I will surely go back to the game in the future though. Kudos to this indie dev for making a pretty good game! I recommend giving it a shot if you love dogs & cats. In my opinion, the game is not worth the base price. Try grabbing it at a sale. If they add more content that doesn’t allow the game to become stale quickly, then it would be worth the $19.99!Reviewer: MidplayzDogs come when they’re called; cats take the message & get back to you later…Rating: 8/10 Please follow United Critics for more quality reviews."}, {"username": "StarLord179", "comment": "i would give the game 5/10 because when you start it is fine then you get a expand ticket and then get a cat house and then a clinic and you don't have room but it is a fun game"}, {"username": "Joanna", "comment": "Super buggy.

It was a painful and difficult decision.I cannot recommend the game as it is right now. The PC Port is really bad to the point that it ruins the game experience.If you take a look closely at the Steam reviews, almost all positive reviews are just people simping for Adachi. Most of the real reviews of this game are negative due to the terrible port.P4AU itself is an incredible game, very fun to play with excellent characters and a very colorful, flashy and vibrant visuals.My PS3 broke due to a power surge that came from the network cable in a stormy day about a month after P4AU got released 9 years ago so I could never play it since then. I was really excited to finally be able play it now in current-gen hardware, especially on PC, but unfortunately the awful port ruined my experience of this great game.There are several random crashing issues in different modes, very inconsistent audio volumes that are either inaudibly quiet or freaking loud, plus video playback issues (init render and separate \"active movie window\" pop-up).The developers didn't even bother to upscale the game graphical assets from 720p to a higher resolution.Online matching crashes when searching for rooms with more than 2 slots and when it finds any rooms there are like only 3 people available. Ranked works but I can only find like 4 people with a 0 bar connection. I understand that this game is not popular in my region but I was expecting to find more than 7 people online at launch day.Lobbies have been removed in this version for no real reason.Atlus completely trolled us all at launch by unlocking the game 5 hours after the Steam page release time.The game is expensive for a bad 9 year old \"remaster\" and doesn't have regional pricing. I decided to buy it anyway because I'm a big Persona fan and I was really excited to play this game that I could never play for 9 years. The game itself is excellent, but the terrible PC Port and the big number of issues alongside a bad delay based netcode completely ruined the enjoyment of the game.Maybe I'll reconsider buying it again once rollback is implemented and the issues are fixed, but for now I can't recommend P4AU in it's current state. The negatives are greater than the positives and I felt a big disrespect from Atlus this time. I wasted too much time waiting the game troll release time, trying to fix the port issues, and trying to find people with acceptable connection online.It was a difficult decision, but I had to refund it unfortunately."}]}, {"game_id": "1874170", "game_title": "Shredders", "reviews": [{"username": "Danheroman", "comment": "Now they need to make skate4!"}, {"username": "Goodyy", "comment": "what ubisoft meant to make"}, {"username": "TheBahrbarian", "comment": "Trues successor to SSX3, fantastic physics.

There is Pokemon, with IV breeding, Sonic Adventure with the Chao Garden, Planet Zoo... and then there is Wobbledogs.Wobbledogs scratches that itch in a way that the other games can't. At first glance the game doesn't look like much. It's very rectangular, very wobbly, the music is repetitive, and there isn't a significant amount to do. But it makes up for what it lacks in sheer number of legs. See, the point of the game is to crossbreed the lovable near-gelatinous dogs over and over until you've created an abomination worthy of its own entry in the Monster Manual, and from what I have seen the community is still debating on if there are any limitations besides your own hardware. You can just keep breeding more legs onto them. More heads. More tails. Or have a dog with 3 heads, one wing and no legs. I bred a table once.While the dogs(?) aren't having their DNA shoved into a breeding simulation machine of questionable reliability, they live in very cute and customizable habitat cubes that can be connected with hamster tunnels. Furniture items can be easily unlocked by capsule balls that are... dropped by your dogs(?), and there are many ways to create unique and fun habitats.Wobbledogs are also virtual pets requiring care and attention. You need to feed them, clean up their excretions, pupate them as they come of age, and account for their mobility issues as you breed them into non-functionality. What you feed them has an impact on how they grow and mutate, so you do need to take care with their diet. Your reward for this hard work is a single unfertilized egg, which can be used to make more abominations. After that they either live in storage for all eternity, or they exist until they die. If they die after you did a good job taking care of them, it rewards your other dogs(?) with a \"feast\". Actually it does that if you did a bad job. This game isn't very punishing.There is a very simple way to save and share your dogs, so you and your friends (or random strangers) can crossbreed your unique abominations together into some sort of obscene collaboration.Overall this is a really fun and addicting game. The art style grew on me, like extra legs, and the gameplay is simple and doesn't have much depth, but it is entertaining enough to hold my attention. While the music is catchy and really suits the game, it is incredibly repetitive and I feel it needs more tracks.

I've described my views on this game as generally 50/50.  For every time I've been annoyed that a feature is removed, I've seen a bit of attention to detail that has me audibly saying \"Wow.\"  Hands slapping the steel steps in entrances make a great noise, the commentary is MUCH improved and they often talk about specific history or style matchups between the two specific wrestlers in the ring.  They put a lot of time and care into these aspects of the game to make it FEEL like not just another rehash of an engine they've been using since the very first Smackdown! game for the playstation 1. So, if I have all of these great things to say about the game, why am I also displeased with it?  I'm going to list some missing features, inaccuracies that are inexcusable, and other things I've noticed that..I just can't justify.No D-Generation X.  The music is not there, HHH's entrance motion isn't there that I've seen, no entrance video.  I can forgive them removing custom entrances for a year \"because it caused bugs in 2k20\", but why remove options and templates for superstars still in the game?No retro versions of characters already in the game in other forms.  We have current Kane, but not retro.  We have current bald HHH, but no long haired 90's or 2000's version.  We have 2006 HBK, but no 97-98.  All of these characters were in last years game...Which...brings me to the reason I've seen that they've been removed.Myfaction.  They have removed these aspects of the game to place them exclusively in Myfaction mode.  You can't use 2001 HHH in universe, but you can pay real money or spend countless hours to play as him in their card based, pay to win or grind it out mode.  To me this is the ultimate greedy money grab technique, and has me wanting to boycot this franchise.Jeff Hardy's music no longer aligns with his entrance motions when he begins dancing.  HHH's music no longer aligns with him spitting the water.  Why?  That was a detail that has been right in EVERY SINGLE wrestling game for years, all the way back to the ps2.  Why is that suddenly wrong?MyGM is back, but extremeley limited.  No secondary titles, only a men's a women's title with limited matches per card.  If I literally can't have a mid-card title, I just don't see the point in a watered down version.Most of the DLC wrestlers have literally been in the game, some as recent as 2k19 or even 2k20, yet now I have to pay to have them again?  YOU LITERALLY REMOVED WRESTLERS FROM THIS GAME FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT, TO HAVE THEM AS DLC?  Rob Van Damn, Yokozuna, The British Bulldog and others have all been in recently, and I can't believe I haven't seen these things being complained about in other places.As far as the gameplay goes, not having a single counter button and having to match to what type of grapple they are doing makes it to where I can't keep my finger on a single \"no\" button as I call it, and just perfect the timing and instantly counter everything thrown at me.  It makes matches a bit more challenging, and something I've enjoyed.  I DO NOT agree with their claims that the controls have been simplified this year to allow more people to pick up and play.  Perhaps it's that I've mastered them in years past, but this control scheme seems more complicated than every, though I've gotten used to it.I have ran into some bugs and random crashes.  Hollywood Hogan's leg drop finisher does no damage and is difficult to get a win with.  I've had my finisher bar freeze so that I can no longer tell how much momentum I have.  Downloaded arenas off of Community Creations do not show up when I try and select them in Exhibition mode, but they are there when I try and put them on a show in Universe.In conclusion, if all of these little..off details don't bother you, then by all means, get this game.  Enjoy.  Just don't pay them a DIME on Myfaction, and be wary if you are like me, a long time series fan looking for details that you just expect a game like this to have.  Again, absolutely no reason to have HHH, HBK, Chyna and X-Pac in a video game, but no D-X entrance.  Inexcusable.  Happy wrasslin', friends!"}, {"username": "kingdom", "comment": "A step in the right direction for sure - But by itself It's not an amazing game like people say it is, just an okay one.I honestly heavily believe the majority of people raving about how good this game is are in a honeymoon phase. 2K20 was an awful game and I think the wrestling games community would treat anything even slightly better with the praise that 2K22 has. I'll admit, there was a honeymoon phase for me, too, and I was VERY hyped for this game, since the development team seemed so proud of the product they created with how much promotional content they uploaded leading up to the release of this gameMy summary of this review is that 2K22 is definitely a step in the right direction - The gameplay was overhauled to be fast and seamless, with a lot of the strikes and moves flowing into eachother and rarely is there any janky movement. With the focus on combos, you can press any random sequence of buttons and get something awesome to happen, it makes just about any match a clinic, with CPU and others alike. There's lots of small attention to detail improvements like better match commentary and PPV specific entrance commentary. The version of the characters actually matter on commentary, too - For example, if you were to play as the 02' version of Undertaker, the commentators will actually talk about him like that's the most recent version of him, and as if the streak never ended. They definitely put a lot of love in the small details in this game.I do however have some gripes with the gameplay. The choice to switch over the pin system to button mashing was a bold one, but I understand the thought process behind it - It's beginner friendly. Though I found myself unable to lose any match because I'm just that decent as mashing, and I know others who had this same problem and chose to change to the old system. Characters also recover and get up a lot faster this year, making ladder matches and tag matches an absolute hell. I like how you can spam the insta-recovery ability and pretty much nosell everything, but it can get kind of annoying in PVP matches. Speaking of, online match making is still buggy, laggy and as bland as ever, with hardly any new match types or options to use. You'll still run into just about as many gameplay glitches as you would in any other past 2K game.My main issues however rely in the actual content of the game. To me it feels like in order to bounce back from 2K20, they had to shove some new modes into 2K22 to reel in the fans they lost, even if it meant finally having to include GM mode, a mode we have been begging to return for over a decade now. After spending a couple hours in each mode it felt to me that ALL of these modes were rushed in some capacity, and it made the overall experience of the game feel very hollow and lifeless. I'll be leaving an in-depth review of each mode below.MyGMStarting with this one since it was the crown jewel of most players that planned on buying the game. I got to say, the expectations were incredibly high. With 2 whole years to work on this mode with improved technology, you'd THINK it would have all the features and depth of the GM modes in games that were made over 10 years ago - But it simply doesn't. For starters, all of the titles aren't even in the mode. Each brand gets 1 male title and 1 female title. There is no calendar, and you cant send your superstars to do other things on off days (they don't exist apparently). Every card only has 3 matches and 3 promos (to which the options are incredibly bland). You can only do 1v1 & 2v2 matches. You can't set specific storylines or hire writers. You can only sign around 10 superstars because the budget is super low.If you ask me, the time they spent adding new features like GM character select, ability cards and venue purchases should have been spent adding features that were EXPECTED to be in the mode, as they were in previous editions of the mode. Without them, this mode feels very unfinished and off-putting to play, and in my opinion It's very clear they only put this in the game to reel people back in. It's a very unbaked mode that you will be disappointed by and left wanting more. Hopefully they improve upon this foundation and turn it into a more complete mode in 2K23.MyRiseIt almost hurts to say...but this mode really reminds me of 2k15's my career...and that was REALLY bad. There's absolutely no cohesive over-arcing story like there was in 2k19 & 2k20, and most of your experience will be you fighting random matches with a couple sentences of bland backstory slapped on to give you a sense of reason to go on. There's hardly any cutscenes EVER - The first actual cutscene I saw that wasn't the intro was when I was already on RAW...And they looked more like universe mode cutscenes than anything interesting or cinematic. Remember what I said about story? Yeah, well, most of the storylines you'll play will start over corny tweets in a Twitter feed that you access through the options menu. I'm not kidding. No interesting ways to start or encounter rivalries, no voice acting, nothing. Like I said, it reminds me HEAVILY of 2k15's career mode with a Twitter feed breaking up the matches rather than Vickie Guerrero. A very disappointing step back from 2k19 & 2k20's career mode. They were both linear and had no freedom whatsoever but at least they had a story to go off of and felt like they had a direction.MyFactionThis was 2K22's dark horse. Nobody expected this mode, and it wasn't really talked about very much as a wanted concept until it was officially revealed. It's basically NBA2K's MyTeam, but in a wrestling game - You buy card packs with players to build the ultimate team and take it online to test your strength and show off your collection.Sounds cool, right? Well the experience is immediately soured right off the bat once you realize that there is no multiplayer in this mode, making you question why you should even put the time and effort into collecting anything If you can't show your collection to anybody or use your cards against other people. It makes the mode ENTIRELY aimless.The way you earn currency to buy cards with in the mode isn't very fun, either. Normal VC doesn't work in this mode, you only earn the special currency used in this mode in one of their 2 mini-modes. 3v3 matches, and 1v1 matches.The 3v3 matches are an absolute chore for reasons I've already stated. You're pretty much forced to end every tag match with a submission unless you want to sit there for an hour straight hoping to get lucky for a 3 count before someone breaks up the pin, and even then the matches can sometimes take ages, only for you to gain a small amount of currency for each one.The 1v1 matches SHOULD have been fun, but there's a very unfortunate, unnecessary catch - You can't simply win these matches your way, you have to do certain objectives before you win, or else it will be treated as a loss. You heard me. You can't even play the mode the way you want to.And with such boring, aggravating game modes, you again question why you put yourself through the torture If you can't even use your spoils you gain from it against real people. This mode can EASILY be fixed by adding an online feature to it next year, and can be made better by taking more inspiration from NBA's MyTeam.

Wait until it's had several more patches, and even then, try to get it on sale.The combat is fun and varied, but the modes and features that have true longevity in these games are broken and inaccessible. Community content is the lifeblood of these games, and the fact that most of it crashes the game really limits the experience. Can't use Create-a-Show, can't use Universe Mode, can't use custom arenas. The loading times are painful, more painful than I've ever recalled in this series. Showcase Mode is dull, and having Rey (who's never been a charismatic talker) narrate the whole thing didn't help. I'm sure I'd like MyRise, but after pouring about an hour into creating my character, the game crashed. It's a shame that I bought this through Humble and that I've spent most of my playtime on loading screens or downloading characters that I can't even properly utilize, because I would definitely refund this.

I do not say that lightly. I have written positive reviews of divisive, at times maligned products, as they managed to meet my own expectations.I have great respect for the craft of gamedev and what goes into creating these experiences. With rare exceptions for purposes of humor, I do not review flippantly. But I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, except to a highly select audience.I give Visual Concepts credit where it's due. They've inherited a series from a dev team who worked on it for decades, and during some very difficult circumstances, managed to produce a reasonably functional and stable game that does an arguably acceptable job of exploiting the series' strengths while adding some interesting twists to the formula. And they did this after taking two and a half years off following the troubled launch of WWE 2K20, to try to get it right. I commend them for that, and for creating what is a reasonably enjoyable experience when it works.The new MyGM mode, though limited compared to classic GM modes, has been a surprise standout for me. Setting it up, trying to figure out what will get the highest ratings, and managing a show budget are unexpectedly addictive.This year's Showcase, a historical career retrospective focusing on Rey Mysterio that stretches from WCW to his current stint with his son Dominik, is fun and doesn't overstay its welcome. Transitions between archival video footage and angle-perfect gameplay in that mode are a fantastic presentational touch. Along with the period-accurate visual filters and lighting used in many of those venues and broadcasts.While not a fan of combos, and most of what's on offer here is a mere reshuffling of states and actions with different inputs, the new control scheme is likely beginner-friendlier.Each of the game's modes - from the card collecting MyFaction, to MyGM's management options, to Universe Mode's full micromanagement of everything, to MyRise's branching career mode - feels distinct, self-contained, and in and of themselves fun. Unfortunately, a lack of cross-mode integration was step one in my inexorable spiral toward frustration. I spend a lot of time in these games' creation modes. I spent days carefully creating my custom CAS, which I planned to use in MyRise. Maddeningly, that's not something 2K22 permits. You cannot import a created superstar into MyRise. Nor can you export your MyRise character to other modes.Putting care and effort into a CAS is a sizable time investment. Having no way to use them in this game's career mode is simply not a user-friendly design. Recreating them entirely for MyRise is just as bad.I ended up making a cartoonish CAS I threw together in moments instead, because it simply wasn't worth the effort.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784244540I then moved onto MyFaction. I found it enjoyable. You create a deck of cards representing specific superstars, and then play them in matches to level them up and unlock additional cards. Some cards reveal otherwise inaccessible superstars, such as classic versions of characters. Except... yet again... these unlockable characters cannot be used outside of MyFaction. It's counterintuitive, and killed any sense of payoff for grinding.These odd limitations litter the game. There are no tag team or mid-card titles in MyGM Mode. Promos have been removed from Universe Mode. This year's custom entrances are far simpler affairs, with many important options gutted entirely, supposedly to avoid issues present in 2k20.And unfortunately, that brings me to my single biggest issue with this release. \"It hits different!\" That's 2K22's slogan. \"Redesigned engine.\" These are things you can read on storefronts. Yet while more stable overall, the game is packed with the same legacy issues that have plagued the series for years. And some new ones. The title screen failed to acknowledge any input for nearly 40 seconds if I downloaded too many community creations. Load times when using created superstars and arenas grew to 4 minutes. There is clipping through body parts during entrances, despite tight limits being placed on entrance creation and other measures supposedly introduced to avoid this. Hair looks and animates just as jankily and rough as ever. Many In-game superstar faces look less accurate than community creations do.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2788025464Online play is marred by lag and disconnects (which costs rewards.) There's no variable refresh rate support. Texture quality is a greyed out setting that only changes if you change your display resolution (and even then only if you have above an unknown VRAM threshold.) Altering attires for existing superstars introduces permanent geometry warping on in-game models. As in 2K20 there is a soft limit on total user created images before issues emerge. Once exceeded, images on downloaded wrestlers simply vanish. Nothing warns players of this. I worked for days on a CAS only for one eye to become permanently frozen (more wasted time, & this is an old bug.) Universe is buggy (custom arenas don't save to shows consistently, invisible wrestlers attack you, titles don't change hands as cutscenes say they have, etc.) Bugged custom belts are blank.Then there is the UI and general user experience. The editor has flashing selection highlights that cover fine details and can't be disabled. Minor accessibility features enabled by users don't work online. UI leaves some players uncertain what to do in MyRise. I could go on.The cherry on top? Losing 100+ hours of progress & creation work to a simple reinstall. Something no other Steam game has done to me.ConclusionWWE 2K22 is a game I wanted to love and I have the hours to prove it. I'll likely continue the struggle to extract enjoyment from it. But in its current state it doesn't feel like it respects my time, money, or intelligence. For every moment of fun, there is a frustrating restriction or technical flaw that makes it a grind to get the most out of. There have been some very high profile \"worst launches ever\" in recent years. Yet those games were islands of functionality and stability in comparison to this one. They got hate-trained, while actual broken annualized sports IPs get a pass year after year. Enough is enough.I've played this series for 22 years. This is now the third time a return to form has been implied in some way. And it's the last time I'll bite unless things demonstrably improve."}, {"username": "Cheeto", "comment": "⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠛⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠋⠈⠀⠀⠀⠀⠐⠺⣖⢄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⢀⡆⠀⠀⠀⢋⣭⣽⡚⢮⣲⠆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⡼⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣅⣨⠇⠈⠀⠰⣀⣀⣀⡀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣟⢷⣶⠶⣃⢀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡅⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⠀⠈⠓⠚⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡠⠀⡄⣀⠀⠀⠀⢻⠀⠀⠀⣠⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠐⠉⠀⠀⠙⠉⠀⠠⡶⣸⠁⠀⣠⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⡆⠀⠐⠒⠢⢤⣀⡰⠁⠇⠈⠘⢶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠠⣄⣉⣙⡉⠓⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣤⣀⣀⠀⣀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿THE BROCK"}, {"username": "BulletImperium", "comment": "Currently a crash fest.

I love multi-man matches taking 45 minutes because the targeting system does not work correctly. Try playing a 4 Man Extreme Rules match and watch. AI loses its mind in Elimination Chamber matches, it simply does not know what to do. It breaks up pins, submissions, and even most basic moves because it is HELLBENT on attacking the person its targeting no matter what. AI will often all target the same person (usually the player), leaving you to deal with a barrage of 3+ AI who will not fight each other. Makes it near impossible, you can only counter so much till it becomes tedious.Oh speaking of reversals, the combo system. Instead of reversing them like you would normal moves you gotta guess which face button the AI will press to reverse those. This is not the worst system, but its not great. Leaves a lot of time to just sit there while the AI does what it wants to you, there is no button prompt to give you a chance either. Timing be damned.Some moves are completely bugged, I can knock the tag partner off the apron with a running attack maybe 1/10 times, not because they reverse. The move just misses, completely. This is one example, there are many, many more.GM Mode should not have been put in this game. It is simply incomplete. Focusing on Universe Mode changes and continuing to work on GM Mode for the next game should have been priority. Oh well, needed to sell this game to customers who got burned on the last one I guess, and this was an easy way to do it.The game isn't the worst, it isn't even bad I feel. Not as good as the peak games in the 2K franchise (14, 18, 19), but not as bad as the worst (15*, 20). I'll continue to play, as I feel it has hope in a way 2k20 never did. It is fun, mostly. When it isn't completely frustrating (not in a difficult or intriguing way, but in a \"Who let this through testing??\" way). However, this game feels about 70% done. I won't even talk about crashes or optimization, as many other people already have (yeah its not great).

The player begins as a mind inside a bulky, mechanical body, separate from it. But by just playing, by experiencing the, and, through the body; we begin to replace our senses. Our sight becomes almost null, just a few glimpses that more often than not show us nothing but void, our touch; just a couple of lights on a radar and our limbs; the buttons on the panel. The only one that remains unchanged is our hearing, which is the most reliable, consistent and, unfortunately, the truest of them all.The coordinates and the pressing of buttons just became natural, i began to juggle with them absent-mindedly, just like walking doesn't require mental strain behind every step. But hearing... My sense of hearing never fell into my subconscient, for it warned me faster, more consistently of the threats that came to me, like one hears a possible danger before feeling it up on their leg (such as watching the radar lights flare up rapidly and turn off again in an open space in the tunnels). Just like opening our eyes in a sleep paralysis, trying to catch that final gaze into the darkness; reaching for the camera at the last node, unveils the horrific truth... already too late.Iron Lung is a perfect example on how to put the player INTO the game and truly experience terror as if it were on our own, true skin, leaving behind jumpscares that only appeal to the eyes behind the screen and only show shock and tension through mechanics."}, {"username": "Volt", "comment": "Does what it says on the box.A short but sweet, unique horror experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. It's hard to talk specifics without spoiling when it's such a quick game. Suffice to say, Iron Lung is the perfect length for exploring its setting and gameplay, utilising them effectively to rapidly and organically build the tension without dragging it out and becoming tedious.It's a lovely little game that won't waste your time. I started and finished Iron Lung while waiting for another game to download. An easy recommendation from me, especially for horror fans who are interested in seeing what can be done with less than an hour in one room, and without Five-Nights-style reliance on jumpscares. Give it a go, and don't refund it afterwards, you monster."}, {"username": "Entropy Phi", "comment": "Detailed Video Review (no spoilers): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQBEJVq1onUShort Text Version:Despite being under an hour long with just a few paragraphs of story, Iron Lung manages to create an excellently unnerving atmosphere that will undoubtedly stick with you. I'm going to keep this spoiler-free, because it works at it's absolute best when you don't know what's coming.As you can tell from the visuals, you're locked in to a low-rez, low-poly submarine at the bottom of a blood ocean. All the hatches are closed, so you can't see anything outside without using a rudimentary camera. This camera takes a few seconds to process an image, so it can't really be used for navigation. Instead, you have to rely entirely on the instruments at the helm, closely watching your coordinates, the map, and your current heading to determine where to go next. Your job is to visit all of the marked points on the map and take pictures in each location. This sounds simple at first, but consider that you're maneuvering through this world basically blind, and suddenly everything is a lot more ominous.It's a very unique gameplay mechanic that takes a while to get used to, but it did eventually click for me. I do think some people will find this to be unplayable, because not everyone can visualize spaces in their head from numbers alone. But for those who get a handle on it, everything comes together surprisingly well.Given the horror roots, you can only assume that there's something very wrong in this alien blood ocean. I don't think it's a necessarily a spoiler to say that - I mean even the store page shows massive skeletons littering the sea floor. What exactly you'll find is up to you to discover. But I can say that the game does a great job of ramping up the tension to a nerve-wracking final act. There are a bunch of great little tricks done within the limited scope and mechanics that I would mention, but they really need to be experienced blind. You'll hear countless unfamiliar, creepy noises scattered across the sea floor, with hints at things much greater than you beyond those iron walls. Overall, the sound design is excellent. The soundtrack is also quite well done, setting a nicely unnerving atmosphere to amplify everything else happening.If I had to compare this to anything, I'd say it feels like a love-letter to Subnautica, with the horror ramped up to 11. It gave me similar vibes to piloting the Cyclops through the darkest depths of the world, using the available systems to avoid collisions and the invisible dangers outside.But despite being super-indie, low budget and everything, I think it delivers a very memorable experience. My only complaint would probably be that it felt just slightly too long. I think the sub moved just a little too slow or the map could've used a point or two less. Around 30 minutes instead of the 45 I took would still sell the whole experience while removing a bit of dead air.Anyways, if you like small indie horror games or the cyclops portions of Subnautica, I think this would be right up your alley. If math, coordinates, and lots of imagination aren't what you want from a game, maybe give it a pass. Either way, I don't regret playing it, and I think it all came together in a great way at the end."}, {"username": "Orange Man", "comment": "I LOVE the premise of this game.

Unfortunately, it ended up making me long for a more fleshed out story with more in-depth mechanics.

Most notably, Thief Simulator, which was released a couple of years ago. So perhaps you can consider this game the third-person version of it.If you have not played that like myself let's continue! You play as Jack who ends up in the prison of a small town following an awful heist. As somebody wants you free you are given the key to your cell and asked to escape, get to a motel and also to get your towed car. These first couple of missions can be considered the tutorial of the game.After that you end up in Bar 66 where you meet Stacks. He'll give you a lot of missions and following his storyline is the way to complete the Prologue. Now, what are these missions? They are jobs and are all about stealing something. It can be a precious guitar or just a special whiskey some consider invaluable. You are free to explore the town in a Grand Theft Auto-like fashion meaning you can always hop in your vehicle and drive around as you see fit. The best of the game for me was the preparatory session. Each job (or robbery) requires careful planning. The game keeps feeding you with tips as more and more items or tools become available. You learn how to disguise yourself as an electrician, how to sneak, enter with the use of a hammer or crowbar and how to escape the police. You need to see a corrupt cop to get your heat lowered following a couple of busted heists. Now, just because your mission objective is one particular item it doesn't mean you can't steal other stuff. Bigger devices such as microwave ovens or TVs can also be picked up and put in the trunk of your car. Be on the lookout for parking spaces as they allow you to change your clothes and also to sleep: sleeping is essential as if there are no or fewer tenants in a house your job will be significantly easier. Jack's ability to get better at running or have a bigger backpack all can improved in the form of skills. After each heist you get an evaluation and provided that you were not noticed and that you left with a full backpack you can get a very high score which can also yield you 50% plus XP.I completed the free Prologue and did not have the chance to use any lockpick tools. Also, there are some options in your inventory menu that are inactive. In the full game we'll probably be able to purchase real estate and also new vehicles. Prologue is a great way to advertise American Theft 80s - the idea of such open-world thief simulator is superb and I can't wait to get my hands on the full product."}, {"username": "Hand of Ace", "comment": "Payday 3 looking good"}, {"username": "jontyjohnston32", "comment": "Really enjoyed this game be good to maybe hear some 80s music within in it"}, {"username": "Zebster", "comment": "I have had my eye on this title for quite awhile now and the wait was worth it!Okay; sure the devs and the speedrunners finish this demo in about an hour - I'm happy to say I'm not like either one of those!

If I'd dislike something about it, it would be the extra effects (filters) like VHS when I turned it off I felt it's way more clear to see and more beautiful in my opinion but good choice of filters to show the vibe of 80's.If I would recommend something for this game to add probably is the old clothes, old haircuts and the old style of a barber shop.

Sneaking, inventory, dialogue choice, rpg elements, and tons of other choices create too many thinly developed concepts welded together, while missing key components that make core gameplay fun in either of the aforementioned games. Instead of having 75 concepts, get the sneaking system down first, and then expand into an alert system, etc. I say sneaking, because 90% of the game is focused around this, so it should be amazing, and everything else should be secondary! Instead, we get a stick-figure protagonist that holds their arm straight out in front of themselves and then any door you're trying to go through just swings open--it's a horrible experience that completely ruins the immersion. Sneaking feels like an on-rails, linear slog, that is extremely slow and unrewarding. Why do I care about opening 30 different drawers, each requiring tediously accurate (within a mm of an object) clicking? I'm going to never look in drawers because it's a waste of time. The entire name of the game is literally about the 80s and nothing in this game makes me think the 80's, like, at all. The voices of NPCs are terrible, and don't act or sound like people from the 80s would have. WHERE IS THE MUSIC? Where are billboards, neon lights, interesting character textures, or anything that would \"wow\" me? To that point, the graphics look like Unity from 2005 with 1998 load times.

Playing with the basic characters is fine to start, but quickly becomes repetitive. The second issue is the lack of a player base. After playing in the arena for two days, I was already in the top 250 in the world. This led to longer and longer wait times to play anything except asychronous games. It is also sometimes frustrating with the few daily quests as some are nearly impossible when playing against other non-paying players.

That is to say, its not \"pay to win\" but more like pay to never lose. That means both lose games against opponents that have payed AND lose excess resources you have accumulated. For a \"free to play\" player it can be very annoying when you reach the resource cap, which can happen very quickly. After capping out my beans, tears and XP I find no reason to continue playing since I cant progress any further. If you have patience and restrain playing an hour everyday should be enough to make steady progress. However, the game's monetization system is very exploitative. You can quickly lose count of the money you spent and the actual \"worth\" of the fake currency and resources you are paying for. And as I mentioned in the beginning, the game is very addicting. The art-style feels like eye-candy to my eyes and the vivid colors captivates your attention. The animation played in the beginning does an amazing job at drawing your attention for the first time playing. That took me by surprise and I thought it was the start of an interesting story. However after walking you through the tutorial, the narrative didn't lead anywhere. I will continue to keep playing for a while just to see if my opinion about the game changes. For now I do Not Recommend this game for the majority of people since I find it highly likely you will unnecessarily spend money on this. An underlying problem I have with this game is that it looks suspiciously like a cash-grabbing machine. For all the love that certainly went into this game, I get the unsettling feeling that the game wont be regularly updated and properly managed. Also, I find it hard for an invested, healthy and long lasting community to be created around this game.

Charming graphics, fun gameplay loop. Overall, I recommend it. But there are issues you should be aware of before you buy. This game has some rough edges. First, I'll give you a couple tips if you're a complete noob. Firstly, this is not really an autobattler. If you don't ever control your troops at all, you'll lose a lot more often. Magic is extremely OP, get as many spells for your hero as possible. Pay attention to where your enemy's reinforcements spawn, and put long lasting AOE (area of effect) spells on that location.(spells like meteor rain, siege rain, etc). Whenever possible, use aforementioned AOE spells to disrupt your enemy's ranged units. Position your big beefy guys and melee troops in front of your ranged troops before the battle to maximize their effectiveness. If you have a fast group of units, it's always a good idea to position them away from your main army so you can flank the enemy ranged troops. Most ranged troops cannot attack at melee range or their damage is greatly reduced, so the faster you can get troops in their face the better. Last tip for battles is a tactic called \"hammer and anvil.\" Summoning spells are good for this tactic. If you summon troops behind your enemy's front line and then smash into the enemy with your own troops from the other side, the enemy will be stuck fighting in two directions and you'll have the advantage. Very effective tactic. Rough Edges:-The UI doesn't scale particularly well. The minimap gets in the way. Either it's too small to read anything on it, or it's too huge and takes up too much of the screen-Game needs a \"turn off mouse scrolling\" menu option. In battles when you're trying to move troops around from reserves or cast spells and you move your cursor down, the camera also starts scrolling down. It's incredibly irritating. It sort of works to hold W to keep the camera still while you click stuff on the bottom action bars, but it's not a great fix.-The game doesn't control super smoothly, it's clunky and too easy to misclick, and in battles the \"drip\" feature bugs out frequently when you're trying to move guys to or from reserves. -The AI cheats (as in it gets more resources than you), so you need to be aware of that if you want to win. -In larger games, waiting for AI turns gets extremely tedious if there are 3+ AIs. The game also seems to slow down a ton, so I suspect it has optimization issues despite its simple graphics. -This game is not well balanced, but I don't consider that a bad thing. It lets you do some bonkers strategies that are 2000% unfairly overpowered, but I think that adds to the game's charm."}, {"username": "dbemont", "comment": "The good:  superb gameplay, interesting strategic choices, widely varied factions and heroes and maps for endless replayability, an AI that can play the gameThe downsides:  Lots of information needed to make strategic choices is either inconvenient to find, or totally unavailable.  Some hero skills are well defined, others not at all.  And the UI has some VERY rough edgesAlso to consider:  The strategic map looks so much like Heroes of Might and Magic 3 that a lot of gamers are frustrated to find that the strategies here are quite dramatically different.  So much of this game is about very specialized hero skills.  And until you figure out the significance of the Bodyguard skill, you are going to have a tough time.

I would be writing a raving review about how good this game is if not for the new price. I feel the developer is extremely greedy to be asking this price for this quality of game. Basically yes, the game is fun, you can sink 10+ hours into it, but the gameplay gets kind of stale, and lag can decrease enjoyability. It's an interesting concept mixing some aspects of strategy and RPG, and the factions are all reasonably unique and interesting. This said, there's only 3 factions I've even played (Decaying, Enclave, and Wild) since the other factions seem boring to me.I will say that I'm extremely disappointed to see the developer increasing the cost so much. This is a very basic game and I felt like I got my money's worth at $10 CAD when I purchased during early access. However, at $20, with extra $7 for supporter pack, it really seems to be over-reaching in my mind. If you look at Terraria at $11 CAD, Stardew Valley at $15 CAD, and Vampire Survivor at $3, I just can't justify spending $20 on this.This game really uses a lot of CPU and is not optimised to run without lag on large battles.

But the music.. well, you know those catchy tunes that stick in your head? It's like that but not in a good way. It's honestly annoying and if this loops in your head.. argh. Yeah, better to listen some other music while you play this.============Now gameplay-wise the game is fine - if you've played HoMM you know how it works. You pick your faction (11 choices) and pick your hero (6 choices per faction).You get a random map generated based on templates and get thrown into the game. You build your town/castle pretty much like in HoMM, though the \"techtrees\" are somewhat randomized. You buy troops for your hero and explore, fight monsters, conquer mines and level up your hero, gaining new skills based on the hero you picked.The key difference between HoMM and Hero's Hour is that the battles are real-time - the battle pauses when you cast spells, but otherwise it runs in real-time. And honestly it gets really chaotic later when the army sizes get bigger. Sometimes it's hard to tell if you're winning or not, especially since not all of the army fights at the same time. There's a limit which can be adjusted with certain skills to become smaller or larger - and this limit dictates how much \"Power\" worth of units you can field at the same time. The remaining army joins as \"Reinforcements\" when your army takes too much damage.The game is not exactly balanced. The factions themselves are not balanced, some are just better than others. But the difference between heroes is even bigger - even inside the same faction some heroes are significantly stronger than others (Every hero has their own skill tree).

It's not like amazing or anything, but if you like HoMM and have tolerance for the retro looks, then you might enjoy the game.If they upped the graphics a notch so that they actually have some detail instead of few pixels here and there, and made less retro sounding music, then the game would be significantly better in my opinion - but that's just my preference.But like this, I think the game is a little overpriced - and you might want to wait for a sale.============Summary:The Good 👍+ Scratches that HoMM itch+ Lots of factions and heroes feel different+ Good random map generatorThe Bad 👎- Too retro look- Annoying music- Too expensive"}]}, {"game_id": "1358710", "game_title": "Battle_Cry_of_Freedom", "reviews": [{"username": "BaseScoutX1", "comment": "I've lived in the south 19 years and somehow my voice gets more southern when playing this"}, {"username": "[K98] Schwatvogel", "comment": "Don´t read this banal thums up rep.

I'm not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like \"Nah, i wont like it.\". Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.Lo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game: It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to \"win\" the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. That's when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.So, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it. One last thing to mention before i peace out, but I have REALLY bad ADHD to the point where it's rare that a game actually keeps my attention.

You know that feeling of being completely hooked to a brand new thematic world? Elden Ring manages to do it just as you start your journey in The Lands Between. Fight your journey through dungeons and catacombs, find treasures, get to know your enemies and discover brand new areas, each containing new lore and development that can be discovered by various meanings, talking to NPCs, reading items descriptions, finding patterns that links the bosses and lords of that area to the creatures there. It's everything we always wanted in a Classic Fantasy Medieval RPG. For the first days If I could I would not have stopped playing this game by any means, I just wanted to discover more and more and unravel it's secrets, so much fun, especially when you have friends to talk about and when you realize, they are in a totally different area that you don't even got to explore yet, but the game gives you that freedom, you are allowed to do what you can in order to progress, by your own pace and your own way. The combat got much better from previous titles in the soul series, being able to jump is amazing and having your horse to battle along side you creates a feeling that the other games simply couldn't give you. The hitboxes are better, the battles are fluid ( When you don't have that FPS drop from nowhere, but I'll get there ) and I truly believe that everyone can enjoy this game, you are the one who defines the actual difficulty of the game, there's a reason people can beat this game without getting hit, and even though of course, many bosses are tough especially if you want to play a certain way, you can and will GIT GUT, take your time. After you are done with that annoying boss the adrenaline rush you will have will be worth it. The soundtrack and the world sounds are just amazing, you can hear the noises inside dungeons, the miners banging their pickaxes against the rocks, the screeches of the creatures, the mad-whispering of the anguished souls, the water flows, the birds chirping, everything feels natural and involving. Everything made so that the world feels alive and true to it's nature. As far as the lore goes, it's a Souls game, it will be cryptic but this one gives you much more to know about, it hints you about it's mysteries and what's happening in a way that feels more natural and approachable. And all the endings and ways to get there will allow you to speculate in your own way if that happened because it had to be this way or you couldn't really do anything else about it, letting a lot for your own mind to imagine and distinguish. You'll have your own theories at the end of the game, wondering what could possibly follow your decisions. What will happen to that world after that lowly tarnished changed it. The Ring was a bit broken though...Well,  not everything is as amazing as it could be, being very straightforward, some recycled bosses felt a bit underwhelming and the optimization could be much better. After the first patch things got better, and it's far from being unplayable, but the game still struggles in some areas, and that it's not dependent on hardware, rather, it's probably related to the way it was programmed. Hopefully the will keep following with the intended patches and keep improving that segment as much as they can. Conclusion All in all, it truly is an amazing game and I'm happy that it managed to keep up with our expectations, it's certainly a title that Ill keep coming back to play more in the future. It's hard nowadays for games that have an open world to not feel empty and to not make the player feel tired, they sure managed to do it in a much better way than other recent titles could, and that alone is something that I was sure looking forward to."}, {"username": "WILL", "comment": "I HATE  MALENIA   I HATE  WATERFOWL DANCE   I HATE  SCARLET ROT   I HATE THE  HANDS   I HATE THE  IRON MAIDENS   i like the  jars  :)"}, {"username": "$𝟏𝟏", "comment": "TLDR:Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph. GENRE:Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' gameGAMEPLAY:Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats  (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes\" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. 'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient). In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.  STORY:The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to \"order\". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)STRENGTHS:• Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.• Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.• Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)• You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.• There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough• The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.• Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.• Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.WEAKNESSES:• PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens. • Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully \"exit\" when you quit out until a while later.• Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.• There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.• UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items• Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a \"connection error\" and the game boots you back to single player. • Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.• (Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.• So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).• 'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power. • Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):9.9/10; easy recommendElden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC.

And again. And ... again. And again.Blast Brigade is a Metroidvania Platformer that takes everything about the current Metroidvania Zeitgeist and puts it on its head. Dark and Depressing is replaced with Bright and funny. Nail-biting hard is replaced with approachable while challenging. It's a game that doesn't have many similarities to current average MEtroidvanias, and that's what makes it my recommendation. I just enjoy my time in it - it feels good on a basic level that just makes it a joy to play and replay.(I've spent many hours playing the public demo and the influencer demos before, and bought the game right out the gate. I enjoy every time I start the game back up. I am glad to see that it's finally made it to Early Access and gives the \"real\" experience now.)Platforming & ShootingThe Core gameplay is super crisp and responsive. The aiming has a slight assist to it (on controller) that gives a bit more control over targetting. Air control is good. Sometimes the aiming with special weapons can be a bit tricky (especially on the sniper), but it just takes a bit of practice. The selection of different guns is varied, and provides good tools for solving different kinds of situations.VisualsThis is certainly a different style than what we usually see in Metroidvanias these days. It's bright, it's colorful and it's outdoors. It's fun to see and I especially adore the animations. It's very smooth and feels satisfying. Explosions and SFX fit nicely into the game and style without beeing overbearing. The colors are bright but leave enough room for clear readability. There are occasional background assets that seem a bit too blurry or background animation that's a bit choppy, but it doesn't harm the overall impression.Metroidvania-nessBlast Brigade comes with the expected ingredients of locked areas and skills that enable you to access them. Grenades that blow up barrels, a grapling hook to go higher, etc. The game provides ample opportunity to backtrack and discover secrets. I feel that some of the secrets could be a bit more rewarding, but the basics are there. And the game already shows how it's scaling complexity from the start to the later levels. There are some stretches where it feels like a save-point should have been added, but overall the game provides a fair challenge. I hope the remaining content will introduce some additional secrets, as the ones that are on the map now are relatively easy to find.Other GameplayThe characters switching is a feature that is highlighted quite often also in trailers. On a technical level the main difference is in each character's special skill to unlock certain obstacles or move around the level. OUtside of that, there aren't many differences. So for the largest part I find myself sticking to the character that's needed for the respective area I am in. It's a neat addition that fits well with the story, but the gameplay impact is minimal.Story and DialoguesJoining the brightness and fun of its style, the story of Blast Brigade is crazy. Mad scientists, giant monsters, robots in the jungle... it uses a lot of pop culture tropes and callbacks to movies of the 80s/90s. The dialogue is sometimes a bit ham-fisted, but there's some genuine laughs in there, even though it overly relies on making fun of the main Jeff character. It's fun to read and listen to - the voice acting is great (English only). It's clear that the developers and the actors had fun with this.AudioNothing much to complain about here. Sounds pack a punch where needed, VOs are very nice. The music is a bit uninspired, and especially in boss fights I would hope for something a bit more dramatic. I hope the Early Access period gives the chance to improve that.Early AccessThe game has a good 10 hours in it if you take a bit of time to backtrack, collect unlocks, complete challenges, etc. It's running very smooth, no crashes or relevant bugs I encountered. Very high level of polish on the content that's already there is promising for the remaining content that's to come. It's not perfect, but it's a very good game already, with the chance to become a real treasure."}, {"username": "Checklist Gaming", "comment": "As it stands Blast Brigade is shaping up to be a must-play game especially for Metroidvania fans. Its smooth gameplay along with its colorful visual design make it a genuinely enjoyable experience. There are tons of items to collect and even after completing what’s available of the main game so far, I know that I’m still missing optional stuff that I need to go back and collect. There are a couple of snags that hold the game back from perfection, but remember it’s still in early access the developers still have plenty of time to amend these issues and continue to add quality gameplay elements. Right now I have close to 50% completion of the world therefore I would say the game is a little over half complete.

This game is only in early access and is already a 10/10, looking forward to see what the developers have in store for it. 100% worth full price, it's a keeper 10/10 get it and have a blast."}, {"username": "matthewsharris4", "comment": "Quick Description:-Blast Brigade vs the Evil Legion of Dr. Cread is a brightly colored, fun loving metroidvania that doesn't take itself too seriously, but still packs quite a punch.  In a sea of dark, brutal, dystopian games in this genre, this is a breath of fresh air.  It's a mix of old school run and gun beasts like Metal Slug crossed w/ the Shantae series, and pulls it off quite well.*Notes:-It's still in early access as of Jan 2022, and will hopefully hit the full release in a couple of months.  About 50-60 of the game is available, and I completed about 90% of what is available now.  It took me just under 9 hrs to take down all of the bosses, explore almost all of the available map, get most of the upgrades, and find most of the secrets.  What's Good:-Don't let the cute and adorable visuals fool you b/c this game is pretty challenging.  I was really impressed w/ the difficulty curve.  My biggest gripe w/ the Shantae series is how easy the games are.  They are designed to be really accessible, but they lack the tension that more challenging games offer.  Blast Brigade is consistently challenging.  It starts off really simple, but really ramps the challenge up, especially the platforming sequences when secret hunting and some of the tougher bosses.-I'm not typically the biggest fan of this art style, but even I have to admit that it looks gorgeous visually!  It's a nice change of pace from the current trend of brutal post apocalyptic aesthetic.  Most of the biomes are outdoors and have beautiful terrain w/ tons of bright colors.  This game is glowing w/ life from the biomes to all of the colorful characters that you will stumble across.-The bosses are a highlight of this game and remind me a lot of bosses from some of my favorite run and gun games.  Metal Slug and Mega Man look like clear inspirations for this game.  The bosses all have different attack patterns and none of them feel cheap.  W/ enough practice, you will be able to defeat them.-This is a good sized metroidvania, especially for an early access game.  This is probably a 15-20 hr game when it reaches 1.0, which I'm quite happy about.  There are tons of different biomes, lots of bosses, and plenty of secrets to find.  This checks all the boxes of a well designed metroidvania.-I have been enjoying the story and the cut scenes so far quite a bit.  There is some voice acting which is a huge plus in any Indie game.  The animated scenes feel like they have been pulled straight from a comic book in the 80's and I love that choice.  The story is funny and makes fun of itself constantly.  Could Use Some Changes:-Although there are quite a few secrets throughout the world, so far they have been really easy to find and don't usually offer much of substance.  Finding a chess w/ some basic currency in it is such a letdown.  I wish that there were more hard to find secrets as right now, most of the treasure is hidden in really obvious places.-The guns are fun to use but there is a reason that most games in this genre choose melee weapons or something a bit more unique than assault rifles/shotguns.  These guns are used in so many other games, so they feel a bit boring here.  Maybe in the late game, some really unique weapons are offered, but as of now, they seem fairly generic.-Although this game offers everything that you could want from a a game in this genre, it doesn't really add anything new to the formula.  It's another metroidvania that plays it really safe.  Diehard metroidvania fans may feel like they have played this game before.Thoughts:-I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this.  I'm not a fan of Wonderboy, Monster Boy, the Shantae series, or other games that look like Blast Brigade aesthetically.  However, I had a really fun time during my 9 hrs playing this.  It's not the most innovative game in the genre, but it does offer a fun world to explore, interesting platforming sections, really cool bosses, and some hilarious banter between the characters of the story.Consensus:-Solid Game (Tier 3 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  This is a fun metroidvania that fans of the genre should enjoy sinking their teeth into.  I've been on quite a metroidvania kick lately, and this is another solid choice for those looking for an interesting and challenging world to explore."}, {"username": "maynator1303", "comment": "This game is really great and very entertaining to play.

[apparently there is a toggle in Settings to auto-skip all text]- I had camera issues when using RT to sprint.- Too often, I would wallrun when trying to walldash and would not wallrun when trying to.- No system to locate missing collectibles... some of them are insanely well hidden / difficult to get to.- I wish the \"reveal\" powerup was a) used more and b) had a larger radius to detect.- The puzzle mini-games to link with creatures and bosses feels out of place with the platforming, and was just a time sink vs having any real challenge.  I did not fail a single link throughout the game, and only even took damage one time.Positives:- While frequently confusing, the 3d platforming overall was enjoyable and stays fresh with the powerups introduced as you progress.- Many of the collectibles I found were enjoyable additional challenges.  The ones where you YOLO'd to death to retrieve one, however, were not.  And be warned when trying to find the colored blocks!- What I read and followed of the story was fine, although I tl;dr'd through most of it, preferring to get back to the platforming.- The soundtrack reminds me of To The Moon.I received my copy for free, but this is a game that I'd have bought and enjoyed.

The peaceful approach to encounters via the link system was a stroke of genius and with every wall run, dash, and more, the culmination of the platforming mechanics were exhilarating to pull off and satisfying to experience. The soundtrack was incredible from melancholic piano bits to atmospheric soundscapes with haunting beauty. The story is expansive and will likely have you looking inward and relating it to the current times we’re in. All in all, it’s my current game of the year and it could turn out to be yours as well.Want more Indie Game recommendations?

Controls are a bit clunky, it wasn't as bad in Anodyne 2 - the overworld there being largely fluff and aesthetics - but in this game, legitimate platforming occurs, and the run button works like it does in Anodyne 2- you hold rt and you auto accelerate, kinda liek how you steer cars in games. This means oyu ojnly need to steer left or right to correct your path. this feels clunky still.your instinct is to hold the camera to pan and rotate with your moving the L stick in concert, but here, that will only mess you up as the game forces and auto-corrects the view, making it feel terrible to control until you learn RT isnt a RUN button you use in combination with walking, it's just ANOTHER MECHANIC by itself.  Other than that it feels fine, the platforming is a bit clunky, but it's not life or death, and the puzzle game for ONYX linking is as slow or fast paced as you want. Its easy to understand, and while not feeling terribly important ( I mean, you could just interact with the plants and animals ) it's a thing in the game, so it's not bad. I just don't really see why it's needed in the first place. If the game let me save and quit int he middle of a link, i wouldn't bring it up - but the game abjectly denied my quitting the game and saving whilst in an ONYX link. I do not find this is a good approach, and you can't seemingly just leave a link in progress, and THEN save and quit - looks liek you gotta finish the link first. Maybe im wrong on that, im sure the devs will correct meTLDR - if you want a mario platformer, or an action beat em up then you are going to be upset. I didnt see any Anodyne - style 2d dungeons, either. if you want an aesthetically pleasing pokemon snap-and-chill game with well written stories and dialogue, then you will find a nice experience here."}, {"username": "Eleri Leigh", "comment": "an absolutely wonderful game filled with the dev's AMAZING story telling and charming ps2 era jank filed wonderfulness.most games when you hear there's jank means it's bad, but this game, and all Melos Han-Tani  Marina Kittaka games are designed with the jank in mind. you're meant to sequence break, you're meant to break out of \"bounds\" because there aren't any bounds. there are suggestions, like in story telling they don't beat you over the head with an answer, they merely work you through how the game works, decorate the game with set pieces and environments and you're meant to discover how it all interacts, it feels alive."}]}, {"game_id": "1939430", "game_title": "Super_SplashTube_Bros", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1540100", "game_title": "Shy_Eye_Labyrinth_The_Incredible_Mystery", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1861340", "game_title": "BOMB_Pong", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1887420", "game_title": "The_Lost_Oregon_City_Gold", "reviews": [{"username": "fetelijepero", "comment": "cool and weird"}]}, {"game_id": "1936000", "game_title": "The_Infernal_Return", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1949180", "game_title": "Nocturama", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1885500", "game_title": "Path_Of_Becoming", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1882600", "game_title": "Knew_the_Beginning", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1945910", "game_title": "maze_to_the_old_castle", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1887330", "game_title": "Annie_and_the_Art_Gallery", "reviews": [{"username": "boonydigiorno", "comment": "very neat game. despite the story being inspired by other games, it's a unique plot. very cool soundtrack and art style as well!!!"}, {"username": "bullyforme01", "comment": "It's an interesting game with a bit of scares."}, {"username": "UwU", "comment": "Game has nice artwork with interesting story and mechanics"}]}, {"game_id": "1795370", "game_title": "UZO", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1947970", "game_title": "Moonstuck", "reviews": []}, {"game_id": "1640320", "game_title": "BIOTA", "reviews": [{"username": "Sosich", "comment": "A nostalgic trip down the new-age metroidvania.After completing the tutorial level, you will be brought to a base located above the underground complex. You can use this area to heal, test your skills in a training facility, acquire upgrades on the black market, and switch between characters. Everyone has the ability to jump, shoot, and cling to the wall. Wall jumping, which is required to unlock in practically every metroidvania, is available right away.The only thing that distinguishes the characters is their weapon and special ability, which are listed on their ID cards among other information like age and nationality. At first, only four squad members are available; the others are discovered as you explore the complex and after you finish the game. Despite differences in speed and power, the shooting pattern is what you should be looking at. Some have a slower gun that fires stronger bullets, while others have a quick machinegun that fires weaker bullets. It all comes down to personal preference. You'll generally stick with one hero to the end, with the exception of a portion when a certain hero is required and vehicle stages. Special ability also doesn’t matter; the game can be finished without ever using it.You can buy ammo for special weapons and permanent boosts like health in the various black markets scattered around the map. The game’s currency viridium is dropped by enemies. However, until you discover a larger container, you can only carry a limited amount of viridium. I don't think I enjoy the training facility very much because it requires a recharge after each use. I get that the viridium-filled chest at the end of a training task may make obtaining upgrades a breeze, but foes drop the valuable material at a steady rate anyway.The complex is separated into various areas, each with its own set of enemies and aesthetics. It’s also very limited in terms of exploration. There are no permanent upgrades or special powers in hidden regions of the map, save from black marketplaces, which offer every key item you will need.  This necessitates a careful exploration of the map for the larger containers, as key items cost several hundred viridium bits, which you won't be able to stash in your starting container.Saving takes place at designated locations across the complex. For rapid travel around the base, some sites may contain an elevator. There's also the option of saving the game without having to find a safe room or base. Simply locate an area free of enemies or hazards and press a button on your gamepad. Oh, and respawning at these locations won't heal you; if you saved with one health point left, you'll have to continue in the same state. If you get yourself into a jam, you can use your teleport device to return to the surface.There are no checkpoints, so you'll want to save constantly. Death arrives quickly and in a variety of forms. The traps and natural threats are the ones that hurt the most. While weak enemies only take one health point from you, bombs and laser gates instantly kill you unless you have purchased an additional health point. The most common cause of death is being knocked into one of these by an enemy bullet. When navigating between rooms, I found it particularly fascinating that you only see the room layout and no objects. After the room is fully visible, enemies and destructible things appear instantly. It's difficult to explain, but it demonstrates that the developers are well-versed in the period; it's a minor element that complements the game's overall aesthetic.The enemy variety and design are both rather good. The presence of an entity known as \"The Agent\" can be seen throughout the base, and the black mold has taken possession of all lifeforms. Bosses are essential, and this game has a few. I like how these fights prioritize platforming patterns over shooting. However, they’re quite easy once you figure out their limited attack pattern.The color palette can be changed at any time from the pause menu. There’s a bunch of them and anyone will find the favorite that will stay with you from start to finish. Each option contains 4 colors. While the left and right are only different hues of white and black (or gray), it's the center two that actually make the difference. Obviously, not all colors work together. If you have a mild form of color blindness, like me, some settings may even make the experience uncomfortable. The Orion or Neptune palettes, for example, made my eyes hurt by making the screen pulsate. Wave is similar, but the colors are more subtle, and it quickly became one of my favorites. New palette options are unlocked by collecting specimen found in plain sight or hidden behind a breakable wall. A few notes here. The freshly acquired palettes, for starters, aren't marked. It's tough to keep track of which palettes are new when there are so many. It's also a pain to switch between them; you have to go through each one separately. And second, the breakable walls have no visual clue that there’s something behind them. Shooting at every wall section in the room is not fun.Music is great, it has that nostalgic ’80 feel with its synth beats. The intro, on the other hand, could benefit from a lower volume because the bass clashes with the narrator's deep voice. No big deal because that’s the only time you’ll be hearing it. The game relies solely on subtitles, which could require a minor tweak. All words are crammed into the upper portion of the large text box that displays during cutscenes, leaving the bottom part unused and making the text difficult to read. I believe that adding more space between lines would help.Achievements encourage you to replay the game and race against the clock. There's also a shooting gallery available right away, where you have to hit targets with a sniper, who is possibly the game's most underutilized character. The sniper is stationary; all you're doing is moving the crosshair and firing at targets. One final frustration for achievement hunters is that once you've completed the game, you can't go back and look for missing items. And the achievement for collecting 15 specimens did not unlock."}, {"username": "I Love Indies", "comment": "B.I.O.T.A. is a retro metroidvania, similar in looks and tone to fellow indies 'Xeodrifter' and 'Gato Roboto'. The gorgeous pixel-art really pops on screen and the chiptune synth soundtrack perfectly accompanies the old-school Gameboy feel. The action takes place on a mining colony. There's been an alien infestation, and it's your job as a band of mercenaries to investigate and destroy the mutant scourge!Whilst BIOTA is labelled a metroidvania, it's is more linear than you'd expect. The map is fully outlined from the start, and most biomes need to be approached in a set order. There's an elevator fast travel mechanic, allowing you to quickly return back to HQ. As a result, backtracking is, refreshingly, kept to a minimum, with repeated visits to areas only needed for story items, or if you want to find all the secrets and get that magical 100% completion. To access many of the locked biomes, pass cards or other items are required, instead of new skills. Health and weapon upgrades are sold at the various Black Markets scattered across the map. To mix things up, there's arcade style areas where you take control of a giant mech, a submarine and a space ship. The story campaign should last you 5-7 hours, and features two endings. There's an additional four characters waiting to be unlocked, along with time trial levels and a target shooting mini game. The graphics are highly customizable, with 24 colour palettes available from the off, with a further 30 to unlock while playing. There's a lot to love here; I found the ability to manually save after any cleared room a real time saver.BIOTA is a super retro package, full of content and well worth the low asking price.

Because of how VBridger works, it is currently incompatible with other 3rd-party plugins that rely on parameter injection, though this is a shortcoming of VTubeStudio's interactions with multiple injection-based plugins. In the meantime, the only workaround is to change all of VBridger's output parameters to custom parameters (which requires the Editor DLC), and then having a compatibility patch for each plugin to use those parameters instead of the vanilla inputs."}, {"username": "Utaru", "comment": "The app makes an immediately noticeable impact on the responsiveness of Live2D models, even if they haven't been created using iPhone mouth shapes.

You can use this area to heal, test your skills in a training facility, acquire upgrades on the black market, and switch between characters. Everyone has the ability to jump, shoot, and cling to the wall. Wall jumping, which is required to unlock in practically every metroidvania, is available right away.The only thing that distinguishes the characters is their weapon and special ability, which are listed on their ID cards among other information like age and nationality. At first, only four squad members are available; the others are discovered as you explore the complex and after you finish the game. Despite differences in speed and power, the shooting pattern is what you should be looking at. Some have a slower gun that fires stronger bullets, while others have a quick machinegun that fires weaker bullets. It all comes down to personal preference. You'll generally stick with one hero to the end, with the exception of a portion when a certain hero is required and vehicle stages. Special ability also doesn’t matter; the game can be finished without ever using it.You can buy ammo for special weapons and permanent boosts like health in the various black markets scattered around the map. The game’s currency viridium is dropped by enemies. However, until you discover a larger container, you can only carry a limited amount of viridium. I don't think I enjoy the training facility very much because it requires a recharge after each use. I get that the viridium-filled chest at the end of a training task may make obtaining upgrades a breeze, but foes drop the valuable material at a steady rate anyway.The complex is separated into various areas, each with its own set of enemies and aesthetics. It’s also very limited in terms of exploration. There are no permanent upgrades or special powers in hidden regions of the map, save from black marketplaces, which offer every key item you will need.  This necessitates a careful exploration of the map for the larger containers, as key items cost several hundred viridium bits, which you won't be able to stash in your starting container.Saving takes place at designated locations across the complex. For rapid travel around the base, some sites may contain an elevator. There's also the option of saving the game without having to find a safe room or base. Simply locate an area free of enemies or hazards and press a button on your gamepad. Oh, and respawning at these locations won't heal you; if you saved with one health point left, you'll have to continue in the same state. If you get yourself into a jam, you can use your teleport device to return to the surface.There are no checkpoints, so you'll want to save constantly. Death arrives quickly and in a variety of forms. The traps and natural threats are the ones that hurt the most. While weak enemies only take one health point from you, bombs and laser gates instantly kill you unless you have purchased an additional health point. The most common cause of death is being knocked into one of these by an enemy bullet. When navigating between rooms, I found it particularly fascinating that you only see the room layout and no objects. After the room is fully visible, enemies and destructible things appear instantly. It's difficult to explain, but it demonstrates that the developers are well-versed in the period; it's a minor element that complements the game's overall aesthetic.The enemy variety and design are both rather good. The presence of an entity known as \"The Agent\" can be seen throughout the base, and the black mold has taken possession of all lifeforms. Bosses are essential, and this game has a few. I like how these fights prioritize platforming patterns over shooting. However, they’re quite easy once you figure out their limited attack pattern.The color palette can be changed at any time from the pause menu. There’s a bunch of them and anyone will find the favorite that will stay with you from start to finish. Each option contains 4 colors. While the left and right are only different hues of white and black (or gray), it's the center two that actually make the difference. Obviously, not all colors work together. If you have a mild form of color blindness, like me, some settings may even make the experience uncomfortable. The Orion or Neptune palettes, for example, made my eyes hurt by making the screen pulsate. Wave is similar, but the colors are more subtle, and it quickly became one of my favorites. New palette options are unlocked by collecting specimen found in plain sight or hidden behind a breakable wall. A few notes here. The freshly acquired palettes, for starters, aren't marked. It's tough to keep track of which palettes are new when there are so many. It's also a pain to switch between them; you have to go through each one separately. And second, the breakable walls have no visual clue that there’s something behind them. Shooting at every wall section in the room is not fun.Music is great, it has that nostalgic ’80 feel with its synth beats. The intro, on the other hand, could benefit from a lower volume because the bass clashes with the narrator's deep voice. No big deal because that’s the only time you’ll be hearing it. The game relies solely on subtitles, which could require a minor tweak. All words are crammed into the upper portion of the large text box that displays during cutscenes, leaving the bottom part unused and making the text difficult to read. I believe that adding more space between lines would help.Achievements encourage you to replay the game and race against the clock. There's also a shooting gallery available right away, where you have to hit targets with a sniper, who is possibly the game's most underutilized character. The sniper is stationary; all you're doing is moving the crosshair and firing at targets. One final frustration for achievement hunters is that once you've completed the game, you can't go back and look for missing items. And the achievement for collecting 15 specimens did not unlock."}, {"username": "I Love Indies", "comment": "B.I.O.T.A. is a retro metroidvania, similar in looks and tone to fellow indies 'Xeodrifter' and 'Gato Roboto'. The gorgeous pixel-art really pops on screen and the chiptune synth soundtrack perfectly accompanies the old-school Gameboy feel. The action takes place on a mining colony. There's been an alien infestation, and it's your job as a band of mercenaries to investigate and destroy the mutant scourge!Whilst BIOTA is labelled a metroidvania, it's is more linear than you'd expect. The map is fully outlined from the start, and most biomes need to be approached in a set order. There's an elevator fast travel mechanic, allowing you to quickly return back to HQ. As a result, backtracking is, refreshingly, kept to a minimum, with repeated visits to areas only needed for story items, or if you want to find all the secrets and get that magical 100% completion. To access many of the locked biomes, pass cards or other items are required, instead of new skills. Health and weapon upgrades are sold at the various Black Markets scattered across the map. To mix things up, there's arcade style areas where you take control of a giant mech, a submarine and a space ship. The story campaign should last you 5-7 hours, and features two endings. There's an additional four characters waiting to be unlocked, along with time trial levels and a target shooting mini game. The graphics are highly customizable, with 24 colour palettes available from the off, with a further 30 to unlock while playing. There's a lot to love here; I found the ability to manually save after any cleared room a real time saver.BIOTA is a super retro package, full of content and well worth the low asking price.

Business is as usual; a few packed orders, some lone customers to make chit chat with and the occasional oddballs. Yet she can’t help but feel even more spied on by one same patron every day making an appearance here and there… Inching closer by the weeks~[+] PROS;:)  THANK YOU, NEXT~Let it be made known that yes, this latest title by Chilla’s Art (CA) is by far the closest to their trademark hit  The Convenience Store. For instance, the manning of a store- or should I say wo-manning? Miscellaneous tasks, journey to the workplace and the panic-inducing orchestration of some scares. They even share the same initials “TCS” for god sake. Coincidence, I think not!The biggest and newest feature is actually the barista simulation of packing pastries, brewing beverages according to their recipes- which you can then make your own at home? SWEET! Luckily customers are very patient and polite, to your face that is, having witnessed you go in and out the staff room to refer to your cheat sheet. There were some choices, not a first for the franchise; but to be worked in the dialogue and belonging quite well was a treat!Took me nearly three hours before resigning, with- I think and please don’t quote me on this- just a single ending? But those with past Starbucks and or other coffee establishment experience may finish it in two hours tops~TIPS:1) The orders are the same, so you can prepare them in advance should you have to restart a day!2) Can’t get the order right? It’s actually all in “the order”.3) Drink or pastry ready-to-go? Just slap the order sticker from anywhere!:)  KEEP CHILLED WHILE CHILLING AT WORK!A CA game where I didn’t want to constantly piss my pants? Instead, I get a lounge and jazz ensemble like I was also a carefree patron of the café!? But alas- or should I say thank goodness for there are two sides to the business. With the other stabbing fright and looming paranoia set in after hours so it’s a hefty balance! The café interior classes things up, kicks butt and now I really want to be a coffee freak, freeloader of wi-fi person. Patrons-wise, there are some model-quality, super kawaii acts but overall, I dig the diverse faces in the crowd. Until you realize that also means more to go through in the event of having to pick one from a line-up~:)  SHIFT. HAPPENS. I’m sure it’s fairly obvious by now that I have difficulty talking about The Closing Shift without constantly referencing The Convenience Store… But I’ll try anyway; a tragic, “unrequited” love story and one of growing obsession. It utterly milks this plot line for everything it’s got, tosses in a café to entertain and totally NOT to distract you from what happens when your attention is directed elsewhere in pleasing customers.But yes, if I had to bring in an analogy- it is P2 (2007) coming in for the kill on The Convenience Store (2020). Can’t believe it’s only been about two years for the latter…! Good times!! While there isn’t much in the characterization of the protagonist, we can still infer as to why she’s working there. And it is certainly not to be targeted. The only thing that remains a mystery is the perpetrator’s motives~:)  JACK THE BEAN-STALKER…The horror isn’t as underlying or immaterial as The Convenience Store where every shopper had that air of death or at least having faced it. Here, there is a face attached and at times, multiple ones… But only because over time of memorizing recipes and having your back turned- you sort of “forget” how they look. It doesn’t help that there are patrons who also hit on you and demand your number! Or catching mere fragments of the customers talking aloud about being leered at while on a bus journey.The answer is blatantly palpable until it physically hurts. And it shifts into a matter of waiting for them to act! The wait is insufferable, and meanwhile you jump at every noise near your apartment complex. You focus on the patrons, more than is deemed healthy! I tell you, as someone who’s worked in a café before and never worried about it, because thankfully it didn’t open too late. Now it will be all that’s on my mind so thanks a lot CA for ruining yet another profession. I’m kidding… sort of, as it’s more to raise awareness on the issue~https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783656527[-] CONS;:(  JUST DOESN’T REGISTER?The whipping up of beverage portion is wholesome and fun to get into. But there were some glaring gameplay issues with it. For instance, inserting an empty blender jug will have it perform its grind animation even with nothing in it. Some workstations, like when drinks are on the coffee dispenser- they cannot be used for mixing ingredients and instead have to be relocated to another place mat. It sounds very petty and I realize it as I’m typing but it’s enough to make anyone snap~:(  A SLOPPY EMPLOYEE…The huge difference between this and previous titles is its predictability, which is even more visible than usual! For one thing, if you played The Convenience Store- you’ll see a lot of similarities already which do ruin things in terms of expectations. And another it’s turned into more of a series of slasher tropes which would be fine in games like those by Puppet Combo~:( TOO MUCH INGREDIENTS!The story and direction are not exempted from this! In that they stray from the reputable formula of oozing paranormal behind the everyday occurrences… But here, not once did I think it had any other explanation apart from the obvious and mortal danger~BUGS:x Cars have no drivers!x Can go into/crash into/hitch a ride in cars.x Car asset missing and then suddenly reappearing. Could be intentional?x One customer stuck in the same looped animation and as conversation wasn’t even done. No order ticket was produced.x Some models had bizarrely fast walking speeds and appeared stiff-jointed!x Drinks can be stacked together at the collection area.x TV footage apparently don’t change until you “look closer”.NITPICKS:~ Cannot simply return to main menu without having to quit first.~ Can put back some items and not others.~ Beverage making is hard enough with the cups being empty. At least have the labels for what’s already in them! Besides the inventory…~ Cups to be disposed don’t correlate to orders prior to start of shift.~ Tutorial tapes play on a very small screen and is in Japanese regardless of language chosen.~ One dialogue choice left untranslated.\"- THIS IS THE LAST STRAW…!\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783657446Last Words?Latest CA entry is a misnomer in the franchise. Been done in The Convenience Store only now with more drinks… With a threat that’s always known. Still strange but I do fret as to what’s next~ If you like The Convenience Store and are finding a reason to NOT work late nights. If you love The Convenience Store but want a less scary, more chill version. Even as the series’ black sheep- it still offers a great deal.

Making the drinks is surprisingly entertaining although that's not what makes The Closing Shift so great.The ordinariness of the situation - a girl working the closing shift at a coffee shop - grounds the story in reality and makes for a truly eerie experience. The game plays on very real fears (the dark, stalkers, and being alone to name a few) to create an uneasy atmosphere, building up the horror rather than simply relying on cheap jumpscares.Graphics and Atmosphere: 4/5The graphics are excellent and the game has a striking 90s/VHS aesthetic which complements the tone of the game well. The Closing Shift's atmosphere is dark and moody although doesn't shy away from moments of comedy, which I found to be a welcome inclusion in the narrative.The character models and, particularly the walking, animations are janky but I find it adds to the unsettling vibe of the game rather than detracts from it. There's something uncanny about that way the customers look at you, which reflects well the unease of having people's gaze on you knowing they could be your stalker.Performance: 4/5The game runs smoothly and I only encountered one bug whereby a piece of the environment didn't appear properly (although this was fixed with a quick restart).Recommendation: Definitely worth full price!"}, {"username": "LizardKuwīfu", "comment": "I had been looking forward to this game for a pretty long time, and wow, I think this honestly might be one of my favourite if not my favourite Chilla's Art game.

At this point in time the game is NOT worth 10$...It is not finished. The UI is a mess, filled with info that is very unrelated to what you are doing. The sensitivity finder - which is the whole selling point - is very very messy. I input my current sens and lets say its 1 for this example. It will put a range that is super high like 5x higher than what you play. And then you play scenarios that you cannot even aim at because you move your mouse half and inch and you do a 360... Look if all you need is a sense finder, just play some free aim trainer and try out different sens and look at your stats, that way you can control by how much you are going up or down the scale. Because this is making me worse at aiming rather than better... You forget your muscle memory when it jumps you 5x higher than your usual sens...Overall i do not recommend at this point in time. The dev team seems super chill and nice but the game is just not ready and not worth 10$ in my opinion. It has very very very few scenarios which is understandable since its new but they should have waited longer or hired more people to have a bigger library. NEGATIVES:  - Settings page is very confusing - Landing page is a mess - Sens finder is a big miss atleast in my case - Very choppy on some scenarios with fps dropping randomly - The fact that you have to convert to their sens is a bit annoying as well. Just let me select a game and show me that sens so i can understand how much up and down you taking my sens...

Stop making ads about it and focus on the software itself"}, {"username": "Tinky Winky", "comment": "So I have spent some time in the game playing around and trying out everything I could find. Here is my summary. Lets start with the GOOD first:  As someone who loves statistics, Oblivity is amazing. It has everything you can think about and probably more. Even though it has not been out long enough to tell if the sensitivity finder works well, it seems to do what it says. The fact that they do not \"rush\" your ideal sensitivity and force you to get a X amount of data-points is a good sign. Visually, I really like it. Both UI (visually!) and training look great and I prefer it over other aim trainers for sure. The fact that you can change everything from the sound of all the actions possible to uploading a fully custom         crosshair is amazing. Even though it is overwhelming (see the bads for more info) it is still very easy to use and you get used to it quickly. It might be more difficult if you aren't that familiar with complicated statistical interfaces but it is manageable. The replay system is honestly a cherry on top. The fact you can see everything in there, even the optimal path between targets and the path YOU took is such an underrated feature. I instantly noticed a weird flick I do when going to targets on the left but not on the right. After spotting this, I practice some more and now it is way less frequent and it's getting better and better! There is NO loading time between main menu and training!! Very good thing is that they include tutorials and even video instructions when accessing things for the first time. Please don't skip these as they make the UI and the trainer way less confusing! And then the bad:  The primary point, which most of the bad reviews mention, is the UI. While I think they did a decent job in implementing what they have, I understand that the UI feels very busy and messy. Fact is, you can not implement an UI like aimlabs if you want the amount of information that they provide. I am sure they will be working on this and optimize it if the trainer does well but for now, it might be very overwhelming for the \"casuals\". I have seen some complaints about performance, while I have not experienced it myself I am still mentioning it here. Some people experience slight stutters and freezes from time to time. This one is fixable with some settings but, I don't like the initial in game UI. Having \"weapon\" stats at the bottom, a minimap and text that appears when you kill something is just so not needed. You CAN turn these off but I think these should be off by default and there should be a prompt stating you can adjust your UI. Conclusion: Overall I think the trainer is worth the 8 euros. Sure, aimlab might be free but it does NOT offer the same service as Oblivity. If they fix the current performance issues and optimize the UI, this trainer will be the best trainer currently available for people that are interested in more than the general \"Give me target, I shoot, I am better now\". Anyone saying that the trainer is not worth any money or is total garbage just does not have the brain capacity to use the statistical information that Oblivity provides."}, {"username": "disapproved", "comment": "I highly recommend this program, a lot of people were saying that the sensitivity finder wasn't working well, which is what i thought when i first used it, it gave me the same sens i was using before, but you need to play it a lot so that oblivity gets more data so it gives you more accurate results, I also saw people saying that the sensitivity that its putting them on was way too high/low, this is because when starting a new profile and then where it says to track your mouse pad, do not track all of the surface area, you need to only track where you aim mostly, and you also must put in your previous mouse sensitivity so it can get a better understanding of your aiming style. I think the program could be a little more user friendly as it is extremely confusing when you first use it, but once you get the hang of it its excellent, been using it for 3 days now and its already improved my accuracy, and i am noticing the difference. Most people who said the sens finder was bad aren't actually using it correctly, and what people gotta realise its an early access trainer and it will not be perfect when it first releases. I think that this is the perfect program to use if you struggle in aiming, but you have to know how to use it correctly to get the most accurate results."}, {"username": "yikes", "comment": "Couple of hours in and honestly this doesn't do anything that Aimlab or KovaaK don't do much better. Don't fall for the \"perfect sens\" scam, btw, this doesn't exist."}, {"username": "KaJe", "comment": "I hope that this review isn't discouraging to the developers. And that in time, I can come back and make this my main aim-trainer! I think the concept is there, but it needs work. It's early access and released this year, so it's all right. It's not filled with many bugs so I'll let it slide, but \"early access\" is becoming a bad excuse in most game releases these days.I think for right now, I can't really recommend this product just yet. But I do see in the future if changes happen. I will keep a close eye on this trainer!Pros: Fair pricing (AimBeast's recent price increase was stupid) $10 is perfect pricing, and no paid DLCs Replay viewer is one of my favorite features, and I wish other aim trainers implemented it. UI designer is clean and modern The statistics and graphs are awesome! But I could see it overwhelming for beginners! Have a simplistic and advanced view, or grouping it maybe in the future? Good amount of options in there. Not too complicated for a beginner; advanced for the more experienced.  Sensitivity Randomizer More technical terms like cm / 360 Seems to listen to their community Nice tutorial in the beginning, so you aren't completely lost Custom scenarios, easy to make.Cons:The priority of \"perfect sensitivity\" makes it hard for me to recommend. Though I understand it's per game, with having added a sensitivity randomizer. It's under the concept that you don't need to stick to one sensitivity over all your games. That different sensitivities suit better specific games/game types. WHICH IS GOOD, but I could find those ranges in a Google Doc by other aim communities in 2 minutes, then needing to run 10 minutes of scenarios. (Cool concept though. I guess for non-experienced aim trainer users, it's great!) Some other stuff isn't intuitive, like local to find your scenarios, while the online tab only shows routines.  FOV type / Game terms are their technical versions, and most people who aren't from AimBeast or Kovaaks will understand. (HDeg & VDeg) Scrolling through the playlist and scenarios list, it randomly goes back up. And I know it's not my mouse and a dirty scroll wheel encoder. No clock UI setting. Some aim communities use a clock for their community ranks systems to ensure no cheating happens. Those with one monitor (I have two) need to tab to check the time. Just allow a toggle, then we are good! Closest Mouse Path seems based on your last target kill. Not your current mouse position. I don't know how it would affect game performance to have it run calculations constantly. So I'll let it slide. Most people will have this off, as you usually look ahead to your next target for static scenarios. You also go for clusters instead of closest for higher scores so... Why have a tips section when it's just listed as \"Coming soon\"? AimBeast has \"Arena\" and \"Routine\" sections for an entire year as \"Coming Soon\" and still waiting for the \"Arena\" The \"Sensitivity\" overlay for in-game, only shows Oblivity sensitivity. Most people will be in a specific game profile and not \"Oblivity\" as their sensitivity profile. Either show whatever game profile you are in, or cm / 360. Or get used to having people have it disabled. The game likes to randomly stutter for me while running scenarios, which is annoying. I don't mind if the game lags when doing score calculations like in Kovaaks or AimLab, but in actual scenario runs, it is painful. Most people don't play aim trainers for the trainer. They are used more like a warm-up, but it still discourages me from using the trainer. People for leaderboards, scores, and competitions will look at other competitors. More games in the \"converter\" tab would be something for the future. Other aim trainers like Kovaaks and AimBeast don't list many games. But you are also competing with AimLab's list, which is free. Being able to input cm / 360 directly would also be nice :D While the UI is modern and clean, it's overwhelming for beginners. It's what drives people away from Kovaaks and AimLab at times. The AimLab scenarios (Sixshot, Gridshot, etc) are just a personal gripe of mine. But I've come to hate it, and felt low effort, lazy, and do the opposite of making your aim better. When you have advanced scenarios by community members in other trainers, it makes the basic ones feel awful.I wish the developers and the rest of the staff the best of luck, and I hope to see the trainer grow."}]}, {"game_id": "1766390", "game_title": "FORWARD_Escape_the_Fold", "reviews": [{"username": "Ghost of Ancient", "comment": "Fun little 10 minute adventure game.

High level review is it's not as satisfying as other games similiar like Slay the Spire or Inscyption, but it's so close to being.I'm running into a scenario where I know what the best play style is and am punished for not following it. Stealth on getting damaged is super powerful, the item that gives 2 of each item when picked up is uber powerful, divine staf (2x status on attack) is omega powerful, the item invisibility cloak (no getting attacked with no armor) is jiga powerful. RNG, RNG, RNG, basically anything that triggers faster is IMBA , like ON DEFENCE > ON HIT > ON ROUND START.I tried making playstyles that are more fun and customized but the game doesn't let you. A majority of my runs end in RNG death, the rest die in level 1/2/3 because you MUST priortize not attacking and avoiding combat at all. I want to see these improvements before I'd say this game is ready to play:- When you unlock more items, you should have ways to get more item choice otherwise item bloat means death by probability- More rewards for attacking (better loot/chance for items?), otherwise why attack- More balancing for boring items or way to upgrade items that are boring - Better loadout choices instead of just choosing 1 of 3 spells flavours.The above will reduce RNG grinding 100% and make it more replayable and customizable like slay the spire."}, {"username": "Arion", "comment": "FORWARD: Escape the Fold is a casual-ish roguelike card game that is truly as simple as it gets, without compromising on either strategy or depth. Similar to other roguelikes, you'll get to choose the path you take, suffer the consequences or reap the rewards of your decision, and eventually make your way to the final boss at the end. The game provides plenty of cards that you can also collect with many more to unlock as you play. Your starter character, a knight, is a solid first pick but eventually, you'll get to unlock new characters with new special powers.Each section of a run takes less than 5 minutes to clear, unless you take a much longer time making a decision, and a complete run takes around less than an hour... at least that's the case for me.--------------Watch me play!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pKPZq9dm2MNote that once I get that anti-Blindness card and the card that granted me Stealth if my health is an even number, it's just smooth sailing from there ;)--------------Despite finding it rather easy to play, I quite enjoyed the experience and I love the art. The game is perfectly designed as a short and chill roguelike that you can play to wind down after a tiring day. There are plenty of stuff to unlock (as well as achievements and cards to collect) so in terms of progression, there's something to keep you wanting to play more. However, I do agree with another reviewer that this game seems to be perfect for the mobile platform too. If it's available on my phone, I'll likely play a run or two before bed. Perhaps this is something that's in the works? ;)OverallI love playing FORWARD: Escape the Fold and I can definitely give it my full recommendation. It's just a fun and simple little roguelike that you can easily hop into. There are plenty of builds that you can play around with throughout your runs and there are also plenty of new cards that you can unlock as you progress. It would work well as a great intro for players who are new to the genre too.

I didn't like the game for the first 30 minutes, mainly because the first area is somewhat poorly designed I feel, and the character moves like a snail without the upgrades, but if you stay with it, I think you will find a very enjoyable semi-open world game with lots of fun secrets. You can finish the Early Access in about 3 hours, but there are at least 3 optional areas that I know of, so I would say 6 to 7 hours of exploration, plus a few hard secrets that I can't solve. Don't worry about the walking speed, you can directly upgrade the movement stat at the 'save' crystal, and it does not take a ton of points. I will say the inventory and the hotkeys are not very friendly, it's hard to explain but you have to leapfrog your active items, and if you try to charge 2 spells at the same time you put your hand in a very weird position. Also, the game really needs the 'exit to the main menu' option, if there is loading before death I can't find it.The way the developer structured the exploration reminds me of Dark Souls, the optional areas will have multiple exits into other zones, so depending on your luck, you might take a completely different path, or completely miss a huge portion of the content. Also, make sure you hug the walls until you see (?) signs, there are a ton of shortcuts and secrets. Surprisingly the best part of the game is the atmosphere, not so much early on, but when you get into the meat of the game it really feels like going through the 10 layers of hell, exploring seemingly endless corridors, and claustrophobic tunnels. There is a pretty big variety of weapons, spells, and active items, I was actually really enjoying the challenge at first, but the balancing does fall apart as most enemies can't contest with ranged weapons. Honestly, if you want the game to be more interesting, don't use the bows or magic weapons, it ruined the game for me - perhaps you should add some arrows or bolts like 20/20, there is no the incentive to use melee weapons and get debuffed, outside of immunes.  Pros: + The 'open-world' does not hold your hand, there is a lot of optional content if you can find it, and you are not forced to do it. You can sort of find your own way to the end. You can go back and explore for various secrets, there are some really sneaky areas you can come across.+ Pretty decent variety of weapons and magic, for an indie game anyway. It kinda sucks that melee weapons get overshadowed by just spamming ranged weapons, I think it removed the suspense from the exploration, but it was still fun to whale on enemies.+ I won't say the world-building is like top-tier, but it's better than most retro-inspired games, the characters are pretty neat, even if you don't get a ton of interactions. Feedback:  Hub  - I didn't get much use out of the alchemy, I find the effort I put into finding the combinations is not worth the time, maybe provide more help for the player. The enchantments are kinda weird, even after finishing the game I am not sure why some of them work and others do not, maybe a little help there as well. The stores run out of items? Starting Area  - I would recommend buffing the initial character speed to 4.8 and increasing the mouse sensitivity base and range, it's very slow, and maybe help the player find the key to the door. (wtf is it in the s___, who would ever expect it to be there), I didn't even have a coin. I think that 'no attack' curse should really go, it's just annoying more than anything.  Ranged Weapons  - I feel like having infinite arrows or magic weapons is too strong. Not sure if adding ammo would make the game more 'fun', but I don't know, maybe you would rather add more immunes perhaps, make skeletons take 10% of arrow damage so you still have to smack someone. UI  - needs an option to leave into the main menu or load without dying.  Overall Thoughts on EA 3/16/22 It's a bit funky at first, just stay with it, it gets much better, and then it kinda falls apart when the enemies fail to keep up. Right now the exploration is very fun, but obviously, I would still like more, and I think you can go even harder on the secrets, there were some areas I wish had more going for them. Overall, for an indie game, if you don't mind a slightly clunky UI, the game has a lot going for it.For more niche, obscure and underrated games: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/"}, {"username": "Asael", "comment": "It's is quite a rarity that I come across a game I thoroughly enjoy let alone a dungeon crawler. Most never seem to get it quite right for me, but Lunacid fills that niche perfectly. If you enjoyed FromSoftware's progenitors to the Soul series, à la King's Field, Lunacid will definitely scratch that itch while adding its own sense of uniqueness. Trust me when I say games like this not only fall into a very niche genre, but are just absurdly rare to ever be made to begin with. I've spent YEARS sifting through games trying to find something like this only to come out with nothing. I highly recommend it if you have a soft spot for the OG dungeon crawlers.A little on what to expect and a tad of advice: -Time wise, depending on what you want out of the game, you can expect to complete what is available for the early access in around 10 hours or so. But if you're anything like me, and you take the time to find all the secret doors, hidden quests, spells, weapons, etc you'll finish in around 60 hours. It all depends on what you want to make of the game.-Like its inspiration, Lunacid does not hold your hand at all. Even the Soul series gave more direction on what you need to do and where to go. You don't really have that at all here. It's all left up to you, your persistence, your ability to be curious, and your sense for paying attention to detail.-Starting off, one of the common complaints is the agonizingly slow movement speed. This is probably one of the most common complaints across all dungeon crawlers of this nature. Again, this is where you need some of that persistence to bear with it for a few hours as you get exp and gain some levels. If you are one of these people who have a hard time stomaching the starting sluggishness I recommend allocating your first stat points into SPD (speed) as this will help alleviate the grueling slog in movement.-Take your time. This game is a journey to be experienced not a b-line bum rush to some final destination (and given this is early access there technically isn't one at the time of writing this). The real enjoyment is the discoveries you make. If you get an excitement rush when you discover some secret room, solve the mystery in that room, and you just want to run and tell people; that's when you've got it right. With all of that being said, I'd give the game a 9/10 given what is all here at the time of writing this review. Looking forward to what is in store for the game beyond the early access.

Too much vent crawling, an enemy that looks amazing with its visual effects and the way it uses lighting, but that feels a bit too janky, as well as the fact that when that enemy encounter started, i began to have a problem that caused me to clip through the floor when crouching under something. I think this game suffered from pacing issues too, which could have either been solved with: faster gameplay and more action (having to hide while playing the JANITOR game, or having to do more then match keys to doors.) The centerpiece of the game being an extremely simplistic, even by arcade game standards game inside a game also was lacking, essentially, Janitor Bleeds cant be fun if JANITOR isnt fun, because the reason im trudging through vents is to explore more of how JANITOR is effecting the world, and that involves playing it. playing it for what feels like a lot. If the pace of the main game had been faster, but the game inside the game had been as is, that would have been fine, and if the pace of the main game was as is, but janitor was an experience that reads more like a classic arcade game and less plodding, that would have been even better, as it would have enforced a narrative of an addicting and cursed arcade cabinet a la polybius, which im guessing is an aspect the story of the game draws from. Speaking of story, and this is my final gripe, i really hope that horror game devs as a collective can move past notes, especially notes in nonsensical places. Maybe its just me, and my impulse to ask \"why is there a note here\" overpowers my suspension of disbelief, but it still felt odd. Options like: putting the notes on the computer as an email from an employee complaining to their boss, the abandoned cellphone of the person doing spraypaint with a final text message on its frozen screen, or even put text in the janitor arcade machines, as if someones soul has been trapped in them, perhaps someone killed by the entity.

Little did you know, the twisted game was already afoot and you’re the main character in it~[+] PROS;:)  THERE COIN BE MIRACLES; WHEN YOU BLEED~Gameplay can be said to categorize into two types. First, is the free-roaming, give-chase and key simulator in the physical arcade. Second would be the JANITOR cleaning up, paradoxical game realm. While they initially constitute separate entities, they unhurriedly become interspersed with one another until the lines are blurred. The former has you search a run-down arcade foraging every nook and cranny for tokens which you then have to find and insert unto JANITOR… The latter is where the fun really gets innovative; starting out as an inconsequential time killer before becoming a key, obstacle and bridge between the physical-digital worlds. Each able to hold their own, as well as complement the other… For instance, the ability to cower in 3D by hiding from a glitchy, furious being under wherever there is space and then having to do that while sneakily playing it on-and-off!First playthrough will last bout 2-3 hours, but strictly depends on how skilled at stealth and how fearless you are. With various mystery achievements left locked, it’s safe to assume that will stretch up to 5 or more hours! Shockingly, this was one of those rarities where I COULDN’T for the life of me, get the bad ending~TIPS:1) Once you get new items, retrace your steps- you’d be amazed by what you can find!2) When the bad feels strike, just hide out till it’s alright.:)  PRESENTATION SO FATAL. I NEED A HEMO-STAT!!! What else is there to say when it’s of a low-poly look, right? Oh, I don’t know… how about the eye-popping graveyard of arcade classics!? Its true-to-life layout of the once surely ecstatic interiors, now in heartbreaking fashion devoid of children’s laughter and teens trash-talking. Its blurry textures actually add believable years to its character of being an old game. The monster(?) design is one giant, menacing grimace. Whose distorting, noisy filters and bleeding of blinding redness give it that obvious warning and elusiveness. The sound design is comparably daunting with a false quietness besides the ambiance of a dying attraction… But then you pick up on a chipper Super Mario-esque, 8-bit melody that is almost a verbal invitation. Growing on you to the point where you don’t want a peep of that vile sound anymore but it repeatedly surfaces at the unlikeliest times~:)  WHEN EVIL SPILLS OVER. There’s an unashamedly childish yet charismatic plotline attributable to Scooby Doo and The Cyber Chase (2001). Except with darker tinges and there’s no gang, just yourself! Blend that together with a The Evil Dead (2013) foolishness mix and Oculus’ (2013) cynicism acting as a straw. Finally, you get “Janitor Bleeds” and what would certainly make for a killer name of a chilling beverage!The story in and of itself isn’t revolutionary to say the least but rather how it gets told or what doesn’t is… With an opportune leaving out of details save for the cliffs notes of events leading to the present- you have got to try and fill in the rest. I confess, I was still pretty much flustered by the time the credits rolled but somehow, I’m at peace and just so downright relieved that everything was over~ :)  GET READY TO KICK THE BUCKET…If the game isn’t one ghastly metaphor or better yet, testament to how video games contribute to short attention span or the development of addictions. Then I don’t know what is! Come on, you’re so focused on figuring out the mechanics to the machine and how to have squeaky clean floors. That you may have overlooked IRL a discreet shadow, objects being knocked over, their contents spilling out all over… much like your brain probably at this very moment!Back to the unsung story bit, I dug that the machine was centered on the arcade janitor who probably sees and hears things others don’t. All while maintaining a low profile until the need to call for one arises. I’m probably reading too much in it. Like the kids, which speaking of- where’d they all go? Could they have anything to do with the teddy bears cluttered around…? I thought its reaching into and literally killing the wonderful memories we had of arcades was cruel but poignant.The origins of the machine remain unknown, but we’re not invested on that as we do the mechanisms of it. Why it’s able to be omnipresent but yet we never see it exist in two places at any given instance! Or how it is capable of doing what it does in traversing different planes. Maybe it does things that we aren’t even entirely aware of!? For example, when does the real world end and the game world begin? VICE VERSA~https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790273500[-] CONS;:(  WHY SO MOP-Y!?I’m not the best, not to mention most reliable of judges when it comes to performance but I reckon it could use some cleaning up in the optimization department… I’ve seen other similar looking games that ran much better. Or at least found ways around minimizing the processor taking a toll! There could be more loading screens to segment the areas better. Capping the framerates, even opening up the graphic settings for a more customized touch. If anyone is wondering why this didn’t bother me enough to warrant some points docking- it’s because the gameplay was frankly THAT good and it kept my motion sickness at bay~BUGS:x Entity AI glitches out and forever attempts to chase you through the vent.x During which the chase music also never ends, even when I’ve retreated unto safety. Persists until I voluntarily died or quit the game…x First entity showdown is scoffingly a piece of cake.x Some objects could be stood on top of!x Entity’s red lights seep through closed walls.x In the final area, you could peer underneath the map when you prone.x The final machine before the ending glitched out? Could interact and hear sound effects but JANITOR doesn’t actually move.NITPICKS:~ Aiming for the weapons is off and lacking visual effects. In my opinion!~ Could be a bug or intentional prissiness, but walking away from JANITOR machine will cause all deposited tokens to be reset. Which no real-life machine would ever do!~ “Space” key could’ve been utilized to stand back up instead of fiddling with the “ctrl” to do both functions.~ Option to have multiple saves instead of just the one.\"-I’M JUST MESSING WITH YOU. CLEAN AS A WHISTLE~\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790275545Last Words?Dunno if it’s the arcade venue but I can’t think of another time when I had such a blast in a horror game!

I didn't expect much out of the game, but to my surprise it was pretty good and gave some good spooks at times. Only thing that really still bothers me why is the starting of the game so damn dark (around the first 4 minutes), you can't see anything.Game takes around 2 hours to complete."}, {"username": "(YouTube)Dragnix", "comment": "Target Audience:   Very Dedicated Horror Fans that pick it up for the right sale price   Summary:  Janitor Bleeds is a game that follows a formula that has been established in the Indie Horror genre, and almost sticks it to a fault. To the point where it's hard to even recommend considering the price tag versus all the other horror games out there. It has moments where you can see some flashes of a better game, especially with some of the more subtle scares in the game. But it also has moments that really backfire on it, like anytime the game's AI attempts to do pathfinding, and finds itself stuck against a wall. Or some of the inconsistent rule sets that end up getting you killed, mostly due to the lack of detail that is present with some of the kills. It lacks a real staying factor when it comes to the presentation in the more heated moments, as your character just falling over when dying just feels very lackluster.It's also the fact that in the modern landscape, you expect a certain level of lore and detail behind the story, and maybe my expectation wasn't set right. I found the information in the story to not really be that interesting in the big picture, and didn't make me want to see more of the universe or anything along that line. Sure, the universe is put together alright from an asset and level design perspective for the level of detail here, but it felt very much a paint by numbers type of horror game: making it get lost in the sea of games that are out there.Look, if there was a middle thumb option, this game would get it. It's very much a game only to get for the right price, and if you're addicted to the indie game horror scene as a whole. Because there's much better games for the price out there. Which is why I end up giving it the thumbs down in the end, but again, it's really dependent on the type of player you are. Review Video:  https://youtu.be/NNXd9-nqGoc Lists: Positives: Small moments of subtle scares that can get under your skin smartly. The incorporation of the arcade elements does do a good job of adding to the overall game. Use of assets and assembly into level design done reasonably.  Hints of a better game under the surface, maybe gets better with alternate/other endings possibly. Negative: Inconsistent rule set that ends up frustrating a lot more then it should. AI Pathfinding is lacking. Lacks punch in the bigger moments of presentation.  Nothing unique that makes it stand out from the crowd.  Lack of drive in seeing more of the story: not interesting enough/information packed enough to really earn your attention.

In the life-changing milestones of our lives, this was one of the most prominent.WARNING: It's definitely, unabashedly old school. It's clunky, it's unforgiving, and it used all media types to play, from game to paperback journal entries to language-deciphering codewheel.Luckily though, this version comes with a built-in Companion module to simplify the playing experience and provide quality of life improvements like automap feature with ability to label areas, ability to change the font (since a lot of us original players are much older now and our eyes don't work so well), all documentation just a click away.Even some built-in, toggle-able \"cheats\" such as automatically ID'ing magical items, ability to heal damage and status effects while camping, auto ammo replentishing, and spell memorization.The series is absolutely huge, with lots of areas to explore, turn-based strategical combat, good story depth if you follow along with the journal entries, and since you get 8 full games for $10 its price vs content value is exceptional.Still, it's old-school to the max. It's slow-paced and requires a lot of saving, even to the point where you'll probably save before every door, 'cause you just don't know what's on the other side that will totally wreck your party, or accidentally buy something expensive just to find out the character can't use it, and even the death of a party member can quickly drain your resources.If you can endure, you will smile and you will rage, but you will feel that you were the hero of an epic adventure."}, {"username": "rrdy68", "comment": "My original thoughts on this version was wrong.  The companion app on this one does not have everything that the free download app has but you dont have to load the companion app separately every time and you can transfer characters between games.  After playing a little more of this version verses gog I believe this version is better because to the reasons listed above. For those of you having trouble with making characters use the number 1 key for down and the number 7 key for up on the number pad to scroll up and down your choices.  When you modify your characters scroll down the stats and use the left and right arrow keys to increase or decrease the number. You may also increase your new characters starting hit points in the same way. In combat you can use the arrow keys or the number keys to move as is listed in the control section of the rules. Hope this helps."}, {"username": "Space Hamster Family", "comment": "For The Nostalgist OnlyCollection 2 contains some of the best storylines of Forgotten Realms history, the Pools Saga, which spans across 5 of the games. In each game of the Saga, you can transfer your characters from a previous game making it out to be one epic adventure. In addition to the Pools Saga, there are the 2 classics of the Savage Frontier. In Frontier games you will find the first time in the history of PC gaming NPCs that could interact with meaningfully, even the first time you could have a romance. The final game in this volume, Unlimited Adventures, is for those that really enjoy the game engine. It allows you to make your own games. The negative in all this is that the modern gamer will hate this game. I would never have got it myself if it did not come with an auto mapper and the app that made it more playable. The app allows you to access logs, journals, and hints if you need them. Back in the day, most of this took a lot of work and most of the time you did your own mapping. What remains a nightmare for me is the loot management. For instance, after each battle you must decide what to do with the loot, where it goes, who will take it, and all through a series of changing inventory screens. This is simply no fun and takes up a great deal of the game. The combat is also no fun and its pretty dull in terms of the modern turn-based games out there. Thankfully, there is a quick option that allows for an auto battle. Overall, I can only recommend this game for those who love Forgotten Realms history and for those who want the nostalgia of the old PC games."}, {"username": "TrollerCon", "comment": "Currently have Collection Two.

You also get to import your party with their experience levels, equipment and spells from the first all the way to the third, literally watching them grow from novice to master.There are some flaws, like the absence of a proper automap which makes navigating the mazes a bit difficult (the trilogy comes with hint books which includes maps and the external \"All-Seeing-Eye\" automapper), or the pretty poor sound effects/music (the games were released 1991 - 1993).Still, the graphics still look pretty darn good today (nice art design), controls are super easy and the monster variety is superb.

The truth is these games have been re-released also previously on GOG a few years back. Same exact games. The ones on Steam are no different in terms of the way they look and play. The one major thing the Steam versions have going for them however which would make a good choice for people who are wondering which versions to get are that the Steam ones are more streamlined in overall presentation. The games on GOG come as separate entries in your library. Things such as manuals, guidebooks, codebooks and other content are all downloaded manually on GOG. Some items even have to be extracted after being downloaded as they download in zip files. And then it would be a little cumbersome to search for the necessary documents when you need them each time. What GOG does have going for it though is that they are 100% DRM free titles. Now where Steam shines as mentioned before is how streamlined they are with these games. You get a unified launcher for the gold box games. any games you own in the series will show up in the launcher. so you could launch say Archives Collection One and play Pool of Radiance instead, or maybe Al Qadim, as long as you own those also. Furthermore, documents, code wheels, and everything are accessible right in the launcher. no need to hunt them down. It's recommended to play in a windowed mode to have access to both the game and the launcher for your necessary resources, but the launcher has you covered with a variety of windowed resolutions to make things look nice. GOG on the flipside would require you you to manually go into dosbox to fiddle with these settings as the basic launch only gives you either fullscreen or a tiny window if you alt tab out. It can still work the way you want, but for those not looking to waste time setting things up and get right into the games, the Steam version has got you covered in the best way."}, {"username": "Neferex", "comment": "Well here we are, back at it again.

As you accrue more cards you must figure out a way to deal with the clutter, be it by stacking, selling or crafting, all while making sure you've got enough food at the end of the day to keep your villagers from starving. You end up with a finger in a lot of pies, and it can be enjoyably hectic as you try to balance progress with survival.I'm not sure how to rate it in terms of replayability.

There are intertwined systems within systems of production, resources and upgrades, distilled out of spatial trappings (where to put factories-where to store the stuff) and you need to have your mind there if you want to meanigfully progress. The game has such a great emergent lore \"flavour\" that it really puts you in the shoes of a disembodied sorcerer who is again coming to the world and shaping it. In fact this game reminded me already of the diverse spellcasting of Master of Magic. If the developer adds (or has already? I don't know) armies, minions, cities and summons then I can definitely choose this over MoM2. I bought this game for about 3-4 euros with a \"meh, let's try it\" attitude.The developer is doing themselves a disservice! If they classified, correctly, their game as resource production, management game they could legitimately charge 10-12  euros for it. The fact that you have numbers going up is irrelevant. Numbers go up also in the storage containers of Satisfactory. This is simply, the best distilled, resource and production chain management game in steam now. The developer needs to understand that and the fact that they can play in the major league with features like those in Cultist simulator. The days of the itch.io feature list must end. This game is moving towards Slay the Spire territory."}, {"username": "ヘラジカ先生", "comment": "Orb"}, {"username": "Leiton", "comment": "This game is criminally underpriced.I was told this was an idle game and I spent the next 12 hours trying out combos after combos to get my perfect system in place.Every time I thought I'd figured it out, the game threw an entirely new dimension at me to manage and I had to rebuild my strategy from square one.This game is evilly addicting in all of the best ways, and it's not even finished yet.Edit (25-hour mark): I haven't been able to stop playing it.I only slept 3 hours last night.It just introduced an entirely new dimension of things to do.It's fine, I didn't need my weekend."}, {"username": "kostronor", "comment": "This is the most well made incremental/idle game I have played in 2022!It has:* unfolding mechanics that get introduced gradually to not overwhelm* tons of different interlocking resources that you manage* active components, but not lick heavy at all* A UI that is pretty, organised and easy to navigate (rebindable hotkeys for everything)* The interlocking resources give it that puzzle feeling of this new resource increasing the cap of this old resource which then allows more progress somewhere else* All resources have passive gains you unlock quickly and you can modify your spells to either reduce cooldown (active) or have multi-minute cooldowns but then big splash effects (more passive)* Great music that I am actually not turning off after a few minutes* Its a cheap one-time payment with no microtransactions or any of that stuff* Everything has tooltips and a hotkey to give even more info, with stats breakdown tabs and allWhile I am not yet too deep into the game after a good 3h, I can say it immediately hooked me and will not let me go for quite some time.

I think the developers have the right idea in mind for making a \"backrooms\" game in that is it RANDOM. HOWEVER, I would not recommend this game or even consider playing more than the 50 minutes that I already have in it's current state due to one issue. Don't get me wrong, I am UPSET that I'm unable to play more- as I WANT TO SO BADLY. The one thing I cannot get over in ANY horror related content are jumpscares that take the \"cheap\" (screamer) way out and are UNAVOIDABLE. I think that jumpscares are GREAT and have the potential to be good moments, but not when they're unavoidable,  unreasonably loud, and last longer than they should- which gives them the impression they're out to destroy my hearing more than give me a quick scare. I hope that in future development of this game, the audio and \"jump scares\" can be more reasonably modified for better playing experiences so that I can play this game again with FEAR OF MONSTERS- not FEAR of losing my hearing.

This game has insane potential to turn into a LEGENDARY horror game, one of the best horror games of ALL TIME, like SCP Containment Breach. The game is in a surprisingly good state for being just released. I only have a few friendly recommendations for this amazing game:1. Give the Entities sound when they're moving, not just audio cues. The ones that walk, give them different footstep sounds. The ones that crawl, shuffling sounds. The one that floats? Not making movement sound should be exclusive to it, making that particular entity more terrifying. 2. Make getting \"hit\" more noticeable. When I am getting hit by an enemy, for example, cut with a chainsaw, there should be a stronger reaction from the character. I recommend just a minor screen \"jolt\", and some kind of audio cue such as the character shouting, or flesh tearing.3. Food, Drink: You did REALLY well on the rate that hunger, thirst, and sanity decrease. However, the amount that food and drink items refill these meters should be tweaked. I recommend making food and drink much less common, but whenever you consume one, it should refill much more of the meter. Think realistically: One apple should refill maybe 30% of the hunger meter, and 20% of the thirst meter. Apples hydrate, not just feed. Bananas are POWERFUL and underrated as far as nutrition goes. They should refill 40-50% of the hunger meter. Then, you could have other rare food items like full-blown meals that refill much of both. Keep the rate of decrease for these meters the same, but make food rarer and more rewarding.4. Sanity: I'm unsure about this one. I see that it correlates to certain on-screen jump scares, and audio/visual prompts. I would recommend one of two options for Sanity:Option one: Sanity should refill when you avoid entity encounters for long enough, find helpful items, etc. Additionally, make sanity actually scary from a game play mechanics perspective, not adding jumpscares. The pipes bursting and stuff falling from the ceiling is PLENTY enough of jumpscares. To make sanity scary from a gameplay point of view, I think if it drops to 0%, something crazy happens, such as an extremely deadly entity spawns in that level. If the player escapes that level, sanity jumps back up to 10% and the \"Sanity Demon\" is no longer chasing the player.Option Two: Don't have a sanity meter. This game really doesn't need one, as ambience and entities and graphics alone make the game perfect. Sanity technically depends upon the real life person playing this game. Makes sense that as they play it more, they get a better grip on their \"sanity\" while playing it."}, {"username": "Ha†ecraf†", "comment": "I am a huge fan of The Backrooms lore so I had to give this a try.

The game does a very good job at building anxiety due to the fact that most entity encounters are far and few between (at least at the start), and everything is procedurally generated so that no two games are the same, and you won't expect what you'll run into next. I also believe this game is a step up from the other walking-simulator Backrooms games due to the hunger, thirst and sanity mechanics, which you have to juggle along with dodging monsters or even occasionally fighting them, if you're lucky enough to find a weapon.On the flip side, some things I think the game should improve on; streamer class definitely feels a bit more significant than the other classes due to the fact I found a weapon about 99% of the time with it, while with other classes I'd be lucky enough to even find enough food and water on the ground. Some of the sound effects and screams also feel repeated on some entities, even on different floors, so that also took some immersion away. Finally, if you have the VHS and PS1-effects graphics on, on some floors, it is VERY difficult to see items on the floor (and on that note, it's also sometimes difficult just to pick up those items themselves!)Despite these shortcomings, the game is in early access, so I believe the developer is on the good path to making a great game right now. He just made a Discord server and is actively listening to all feedback, so I've got high hopes for this project which already has a lot of groundwork and content set for it."}, {"username": "StaticArcadeTTV", "comment": "Let me just say-I don't do horror games.

And your main goal is to survive to 10 minutes or beat certain bosses depending on the arena. And as you destroy enemies they drop experience that allows you to choose a card to level up your ship. And there's a huge variety of different cards from things that allow your ship to shoot more bullets, or ones that allow you to start firing torpedoes and more.And each upgrade can also be leveled up around 3-5 times depending on the upgrade. And there are also insane synergies you can get like if you max our the multishot card and the scythe card and you break open a red gem that can drop from certain enemies you can combine them into a crazy synergy that gives you two scythes.And you eventually unlock ultra synergies that allow you to combine two different synergies into an even crazier synergy. So I’ve gotten an ultra synergy before that turns my entire ship into a beast that is shooting giant green lasers at my enemies that was instakilling everyone.And the longer you survive in the arenas the more and more insane they get. They will start to throw literally hundreds and hundreds of enemies and it’s just so freaking satisfying to mow them down and see these little bright blue pixels of xp float to your ship and level you up and make you stronger and stronger. And although you “win” arenas at 10 minutes or by defeating bosses you can still just try to survive as long as you can and get a high score. And as you play the game you constantly level up an out of game progression system that unlocks more cards to find in the game, new ships to try out, new synergies and ultra synergies, new arenas and more. And you will also be able to unlock and level up different perks that you can attach to any ship by collecting different colored gems like the red gems I talked about earlier during runs. So you can tailor and customize any ship to your liking. So as an example I always put the lifesteal perk on all my ships because I love constantly healing back to full after I take some damage.And it’s hard to ignore how freaking good this game looks. The game has a super gorgeous neon light art style and all the different arenas are themed in different ways and colors and seeing thousands of orbs of xp spill out of enemies is just so freaking satisfying. The game also has an incredible soundtrack that matches perfectly with the gameplay and visuals.And even though the game is only $4 it has so much content and replayability and it’s still getting even more updates. The game is already incredible but after it gets a couple more updates it’s gonna be one of the best roguelites that have come out recently.

For under five dollars, easily worth it!When building, you choose 1 of 3 random towers, each attached to 3 track segments in familiar \"tetris\" shapes. The random pool can be improved by investing, and you have recipes to \"refactor\" 3 towers together into a stronger one.This means each build, you're picking based on tower type, tower level, the track shape, what tower fusions are available right now, among other things. Plus the expected TD gameplay of looking at the upcoming wave and considering if your defense can hold it, or whether you can afford to save instead.This is all introduced to you piece-by-piece through the difficulty levels, giving a very effective tutorial where you're always playing around with something new.\"Refactored\" turrets have a passive based on which three tower types were used. You can stack up to 3 (*or 4) of these passives on a single tower, if you like, allowing for miniature roguelite \"builds\" across your defense. This adds even further to the strategic decision-making.None of this is overwhelming, however. Placing towers is simple, since the only restriction is one tower per square. While you have to have a valid path at all times, you can buy individual path squares whenever you like, to bridge little gaps.As for criticism:The game feels a little bit early, and even the developer considers it \"~v0.5\" right now - in particular, the English translation is a bit spotty. Everything that *is* there seems solid, though, and I have faith that the developer will resolve these sorts of things.Overall: Falls into the \"cool little game\" category - worth the price for the fun, and worth checking out even for tower defense veterans."}, {"username": "no_name_", "comment": "A solid, challenging and entertaining tower defense game.

My second run I read up on how ascensions work and picked more strategically... and died a little before wave 50. I tried an entirely different strategy someone mentioned on the forums and again died around wave 50. I ignored all strategies and just went for damage: again I got to around wave 50.Even when I made bad choices my game ended up about the same.

It takes multiple games to earn one upgrade and even when you have them all it doesn't make a meaningful difference to your strength. Some of the alternate equipment is interesting but the game should really tell you that most of the staffs with interesting effects only deal half damage. Sucks to spend all your points on the homing staff only to find that it's basically useless in a game where enemies fill the screen.There ARE combos that seem able to stay ahead of the enemy curve. But they're relatively few and they're not necessarily very fun. More importantly the likely average gameplay isn't that fun. Most of the time your damage builds can't keep up, your defense builds get one-shot out of nowhere, and going all in on something different is unrewarding. Choosing from all kinds of ability cards is a fun mechanic but the more I understood the game the less fun it was."}, {"username": "Tchey", "comment": "I love the visual and the idea, but no.It will be a Yes if the grind is lowered by a lot.To get any basic update you need 25 points, and you get 1-3 per run at first when you are weak and bad.So you must replay a lot before playing again a lot with different stuff.The powerballing feel is not there.Plus, no key rebinding, must play with Arrows to move + Space to jump + Mouse to target.Only good is you have an auto fire toggle.Oh also, no particule reduction option."}, {"username": "Vo0 is a Sleepy Panda", "comment": "Dopamine Dispenser"}, {"username": "Ryoga", "comment": "great game, hope to see more hats and staff ideas soon! add remapping keys"}, {"username": "lewisflude", "comment": "Great little roguelike game, with a fun deck building mechanic, bullet hell elements and insane synergies. I'd initially discovered this game on itch.io, and had a blast playing it so was very happy to see it come to Steam. It's definitely worth checking out.The core gameplay loop is super satisfying, relaxing and is centred around building game-breaking synergies to destroy all enemies before they destroy you. Due to the layout of the terrain you have to traverse, it's not really possible to dodge enemy bullets during the later stages of the game, meaning you'll have to pick upgrades that allow you to brute force your way past them. I'd love to see this super fun core expanded upon in the future."}, {"username": "KAIIRU", "comment": "Terraria corruption biome PTSD simulator.Found myself stacking attack speed/life steal and just wedging myself in the little alcove on the left screaming \"OH SH*T\" hoping I have enough spam to survive."}, {"username": "tsmoran13", "comment": "I love this game.

My main complaint is in the library at the end the bookshelf is climbable and if you climb it and go over it, because you think it's the way to go you are stuck you can't climb back over it. The game also doesn't let you save yourself and chooses really weird times to autosave I missed a message on accident and I would have had to play through the whole thing to get it. Overall though if you like horror games I think the price is definitely fair."}, {"username": "dark_forest", "comment": "Good game !"}, {"username": "Unisol", "comment": "Zemblanity is a good, albeit short, adventure game.

In my opinion this is A GEM and ONE OF A KIND.**I should also mention that this game definitely has the potential for some rather confronting encounters, i myself have so far encountered things such as suicide by cop, what appeared to be a mentally ill person who had a firearm and i was forced to fire etc. This game can be very confronting at times but i think that is what makes it such a worthwhile experience.**I'm not sure you can call this a game as much as you'd call it an emulator. It tries to portray the kinds of situations police officers and other law enforcement/security personnel might be confronted with. You never know what you'll be facing until it's over, there's often barely time to think before you have to decide which amount of force to apply to any of the scenarios. I found myself being sentenced for murder because the assailant pushed my partner and ran toward me with what i was convinced was a knife... it turned out to be a pair of handcuffs that were placed on him by my partner... It made me realise, with every failure i had, and there were a few, (i'm on playthrough 15 at this point i'm sure) that it's never as easy for police as the media and the internet make it look.Overall, i think this \"game\" is so much more than you may think at first glance. While it still has it's fair share of gameplay issues It really makes you think about what's happening and i think that's beautiful. I hope that this review helped you make up your mind about this experience. Given the low price tag i think you'd be silly not to pick it up and experience it for yourself."}, {"username": "wateristasty", "comment": "sometimes i open the door and shoot everyone"}, {"username": "DeputyGinger5715", "comment": "Great Concept! Just needs a lot more content. More scenarios. More Locations. Definitely more dialogue. Keep building on this one devs. You guys are onto something great."}, {"username": "FastLawyer", "comment": "Experienced on the Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed RealityYou can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/1OT-G006nl8This is in Early Access and it definitely feels like an alpha build. There's not much here and this needs lots of work to be something useful. However, for those of us interested in criminal justice, this is a very interesting project which we should support if we want a chance at something special being made. Of course, supporting the dev is always a risky proposition, especially with the Steam Early Access program where there's no guarantee this dev will continue working on the project. Here's what I can say, currently, this app would only appeal to those interested in criminal justice or those looking for very cheap laughs. What's here currently is very bare bones. There is no locomotion or smooth or snap turning. You have very limited actions you can take. You can basically draw your handgun, your tazer, your pepper spray, or your handcuffs to effect an arrest. You just stand there otherwise with the items floating in front of you.Your partner knocks on the door and does all the talking. You open the door (which would be illegal here in the USA without a warrant, exigent circumstances, or valid consent). Then you just see one person in a living room. They usually talk quite a bit and you just hear them out and observe their actions. You take quick action with your items should the need arise, however, you fail if you \"jump the gun.\" You have a split second to make life and death decisions. This \"game\" is running on the Unity Engine. The graphics and UI are ugly. The sound mix could use some work. The voice actor (the dev I assume) could have done a better job, but it's sufficient for this type of app that is meant as a police training simulation. The problem is the limited gameplay. Also, it seemed to be that you can't always tell when a suspect is charging at you in a deadly way or just running away, which effects what tool you would use to deal with the situation.I enjoyed being a bad cop. You can shoot your partner. You get fired if you do so ... but it's totally worth it. He rats on you for \"threatening\" the suspect by showing force. I can't abide by that. The only good rat is a dead rat.Rate 5/10. I hope dev works on this. It's an interesting project that has potential to be much better, but it's rather limited in what's there at the moment.

I love the mechanics, how you have to be on your toes and risk assess constantly, simulating a real police officer's required quick thinking in the scenarios that are shown. It's challenging but fun and I hope more police VR games are made in the future."}, {"username": "kam240", "comment": "Game of the year right here."}, {"username": "Expensive NFT", "comment": "The concept is good. I hope you will continue to develop it because the idea is very interesting. There's a lot of work to be done, but at least in this early version I got the creeps of having to quickly pull out the gun and shoot the attacker. It's realistic, it puts you in the situation of the policeman, who is in every intervention between being fired and going to jail or dying."}, {"username": "BornkleChorf", "comment": "I love the concept of this game, but the graphics is kind of a major thing that's needed in a game like this. There needs to be proper human models, capable of facial expressions, looking around, and smooth movement. Reason being is that body language is a very key factor in making a decision in policing, if someone approaches you with calm body language and a cool facial expression, it's a lot less intimidating than someone walking over with pure rage in their eyes. Once again, I love this concept, and for the price it's definitely worth it, but I'd love to see this 2 man team become something bigger and, hopefully, we'll be able to see that growth through the development of this game."}]}, {"game_id": "1920420", "game_title": "SONOHIGURASHI_VS_TOUHOU_UNIVERSE", "reviews": [{"username": "BIG GUN", "comment": "god couldn't make a better game"}, {"username": "Altun", "comment": "Its like one of my japanese animes."}]}]
