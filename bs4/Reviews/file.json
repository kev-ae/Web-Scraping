[{"reviews": [{"username": "Groovy", "comment": "The best Christian game since Doom Eternal"}, {"username": "chonce", "comment": "TLDR:A decent, neat looking boomer shooter with cool art marred by some questionable design decisions and major balance issues.Visuals:There's some really nice art in this game, but it's hidden by a lot of garish bloom and blinding lighting effects. Moodier lighting instead of shiny and sparkling lighting FX would have lent a better feel to the visuals.Sound:Weapons sound nice and punchy, maybe a little too much so in the case of the shotgun, it's deafening. But for the most part, solid. The music is kinda generic, lots of heavy guitar and drums. More of a heavy metal rip and tear vibe than eldritch horror, which isn't bad, but it does conflict with how much effort they put into making the art so creepy and alien. Missed opportunity to lean more into horror in some sections. Voice acting is corny and mildly annoying, I played as the Journalist, and she almost exclusively spouts lame \"action hero\" one liners akin to Bombshell from Ion fury, triggered by certain in-game actions like picking up health.Story:Completely and utterly forgettable. The story is mainly delivered by what sounds like someone doing their best Darkest Dungeon narrator impression. Something about chasing a relative or acquaintance for some reason to get a special Cthulu key, for some reason, and fight a cult for some reason. It's really bare-bones. The game is also filled with \"audiolog\" style content, little clues on the ground you can interact with to get a small tidbit of information. Calling them clues would be extremely generous though, they all pretty much tell you nothing. It's almost always some useless scrap of mundane information that you don't have the context to understand or care about. I doubt even serious lore nerds will find themselves getting invested in hunting for these little nothings. I stopped checking them about 2 levels in.Gameplay:The shooting is crisp and there is good hit feedback on enemies. Popping headshots is satisfying because of the gory animations. It's fast paced and requires constant movement and quick and accurate shooting. Hitboxes can be a little finicky and hard to hit sometimes, but for the most part the shooting is solid. A lack of alternate fire is disappointing, right clicking is instead the dedicated \"hold up flashlight\" button which also puts away your gun. This is only used for the predictable gimmick sections where they shut the lights out and you have to use the flashlight briefly to navigate. This really only happened right after the flashlight was introduced, and I basically never used it again. I chose hard mode for my first playthrough and that seems decently balanced for a first run for an experienced fps player, but I have noted some major flaws as I've progressed through the game. The first being the upgrade system.     You gain xp from killing enemies, and when you level up you get pointed to spend on a branching tree of upgrades. These range from simply gaining more health or armor to completely changing one of your guns into a different version. This is where some problems arise. Upgrade are permanent, you are locked in as soon as you select them. This would be a fine - if slightly annoying - design decision, if it weren't for the fact that these \"upgrades\" aren't always upgrades. I decided to \"upgrade\" my mp34, a reliable long range machine gun, into the grenade launcher variant. Once you have this variant, ammo for this weapon becomes extremely scarce, I found only one or two packs of 5 in very long branching levels, with multiple keys and sections. The grenade launcher must be extremely powerful right to justify this scarcity? No, not really, it's pretty weak. It has a narrow hitbox for direct hits, mediocre damage, and a very small explosion effect. A direct hit on common mid-tier enemies will result in dealing 2/3 of their health, and you only have around ~5-10 shots per level. Those kinds of enemies appear by the dozens. I could kill about 100x more enemies with the original, un-\"upgraded\" version of the weapon, as it was strong and had plentiful ammo. This is not the only example of getting locked into a downgrade either. I decided to try out the \"throwing knife\" upgrade for the basic knife. Whoops, this reduces the knife from a solid but risky fallback melee option, into what basically amounts to throwing pebbles at enemies. Throwing knives travel slowly in an arc and deal about 1/20th of mid tier enemies hp bar per hit. I'm in the middle of act 2 and I've essentially already deleted 2 weapons from my arsenal by locking myself into crappy versions with the upgrade system. Thankfully, not all the upgrades are like this (the eldritch shotgun upgrades are awesome and powerful) but for an upgrade system to be fun, investing points should always result in getting stronger or having more options to play with, not nerfing yourself. It wouldn't be so bad if you could redo your points or even unlock multiple variants, but right now getting stuck with a useless weapon for an entire playthrough is just extremely disappointing.      Unfortunately, this problem of giving the player weak tools carries over to another major aspect of the gameplay, which is the active abilities you can use every so often by racking up \"insanity points\". The list of abilities sounds cool on paper, an angelic life draining sword berserk mode, a camera flash that stuns enemies close to you, a voodoo doll that nukes in an AOE around you, and a temporary slowmo effect. These abilities should result in a cool big moment of power where you use them to turn the tide in your favor temporarily, and to an extent they are that, but they are mostly too limited to be really satisfying to use. The sword power up for instance, really suffers from the finicky hitboxes in the game. For some reason they decided that the hitbox of the sword would be exactly 1 pixel in the center of the screen that can hit exactly 1 enemy at a time and only if you're close enough for them to hit you back. The sword deals a decent amount of damage, but only restores ~10 hp per hit, and most enemies on hard mode hit for at least 20-40 damage per hit. This means that instead of resulting in a fun cool moment of slicing through hordes of enemies while stealing back health, it's actually almost never a good idea to use this power. All they would have to do to fix it would be to make it cleave across the screen instead, with a decent reach and ability to hit multiple enemies. Immediately, this power would be fun and cool to use. Similarly, the camera flash sounds decent on paper, but enemies have to be basically right next to you for it to work at all, and thus stunning enemies is rarely useful because most melee enemies are fodder and die in just a hit or two from any of the non-terrible weapons in the game. It's a flash effect right, why not just let it stun everyone looking at you? The voodoo magic explosion is fine, if a little underwhelming, and the slow-mo power is just about the only one that feels strong to use. Unfortunately, even this is hampered by the fact that you can't use any power in combination with the others! Why! Being able to slow down time to position a voodoo explosion, or go on a slow-mo rampage with the sword would actually make those powers more fun, but for some reason, you are limited to 1 at a time. Final thoughts:     It might sound like I hated played this game, but honestly, it's fine, I had some fun. It's just very frustrating that with some small tweaks like buffing some useless weapons, improving the power of the abilities and letting you use them in combination, and allowing you to respec or unlock multiple weapon variants would result in a experience that is way more fun. It's difficult to recommend this game for $20 when something like Dusk exists, but maybe if they come back and make some balance tweaks with an emphasis on improving the fun factor of some core features it wouldn't be."}, {"username": "ShamblingGoatMother", "comment": "Forgive me Father because I have sinned; I purchased off a grey market site some time ago and the least I can do now is tell you that It is indeed worth it full price off steam and leave a good review.

The sound design for the shotgun is *chefs kiss* superb. Fantastic visuals, tight controls (and forgiving hitboxes) with a heavy metal OST you'd come to expect from the genre. I really like how the weapons change visually as well to match their upgrade path, truly making them feel unique - and sometimes changing their function entirely. The upgrade system, and the lore/aesthetic are enough to set Forgive Me Father apart from the sea of retro/boomer shooters and make for an easy recommendation. 8/10 based on mechanic and visual design, 15/10 for shotgun cause based."}, {"username": "Chuck Ironstag", "comment": "Amongst the best Shotgun feel in FPS history, true successor to Blood's IMO"}, {"username": "cHaoS", "comment": "I really want to like this game. And it was great fun in the first few chapters. But then it began to become worse and worse. While the gunplay is decent, the weapons are fun and the enemy visual design is great, more and more flaws started to accumulate. It ended with me running out of ammo in chapter 5, so I could not continue to play. The enemies become more and more bullet sponges. And while it wasn't a big problem in the first levels, it became more and more annoying how little sound the enemies make. They often spawn behind you or out of sight and you only realize that they're there, when you are hit with a volley of projectiles, losing half your health. As I said, the visual presentation is really great. But the atmosphere does not fit a Cthulhu Mythos game. Unfortunately I can't recommend this."}, {"username": "Enigmatic Salp", "comment": "Pros:-Fantastic gameplayThis game just feels good.  You can headshot most enemies, which is highly effective, though there are enemies who have clever work-arounds with it; such as a zombie that carries an extra head it puts on after you shoot off the first, or an armored enemy with exposed fuel tanks you can shoot to partially melt him.  There are also a lot of enemy varieties, which helps keep gameplay feeling fresh.  Even a guy who throws exploding fish!-Good level designLots of secrets, great looking environments, and many unique encounters make each moment enjoyable, and re-enjoyable.  A great example is an early map in the second episode, in a graveyard.  There are mostly low-tier zombie enemies, but lots of tall grass.  You can hear them, so you know they are present, but finding them before they get close takes effort, and you have to watch your back.-Solid weapons (all of which are useful)I find myself using every single weapon I've gotten so far.  Even the melee!  The starting pistol is weak but accurate and great for headshotting low-tier enemies to save ammo.  The only downside I'd have to say is some sound a bit weak, but not every gun can be the Super Shotgun from Doom 2.-A lot of levelsTwenty-five maps?  Feels like an old 90s shooter!  Loving the amount of levels.-Amazing Boss FightsI've faced two so far, and they break the stereotype of FPS games having lame or weak bosses.  These are masterclasses in good game design, IMO.-Great priceGame is a third the price of a AAA title and feels far more polished than one.Cons:-Some guns sound weakJust as it says.  I wish they had a bit more heft to their sound, though it's not a dealbreaker.-The Voice acting is badPerhaps they were going for old-school over the top, but it leaves a bit to be desired.  Fortunately, you can skip most of it save for the one-liners during gameplay which are tolerable.Neutral:-There's an upgrade system.Feels a bit out of place in an old-school FPS, but it's reasonably implemented, I suppose.  Even with the \"get more XP\" talents, leveling seems very slow.  I wouldn't say you even get one per level.-The story is just . . . there.Lots of \"story\" prompts around maps and beforehand exist.  I like Lovecraftian horror, but I've not been too interested in them.  It exists, is all I can really say about it.-There are two classes with recharging abilities.Another thing that seems more modern, there are two classes, one more based on offense and the other more defensive.  They have abilities that recharge as you kill enemies.  These powers are generally good and borderline essential on higher difficulties - I'd say they're well done."}, {"username": "Kal", "comment": "A dude threw a fish at me and I died.Joking aside, Forgive Me Father is a pretty good \"boomer shooter\". It just got released and needs a bit more polish to be great (notably in its tells ; the enemies make very little sound so it's hard to tell when one sneaks up on you, and there is no indicator when you take damage of the direction it came from), but it's still very enjoyable.One thing, though. The store page advertises its \"lovecraftian ambiance\". That is NOT true. A lovecraftian ambiance would mean making slow, deliberate progress while being in constant danger from incomprehensible horrors that will kill you, while being surrounded by strange secrets. In this game, you zip around at mach 3 and shoot the horrors in the face with a shotgun, turning them into fine red mist, and read a few scattered notes here and there while your character makes quip. You certainly are in a lovecraftian world, but the ambiance isn't there. This is NOT a horror game. Not at all."}, {"username": "crimsonforest", "comment": "Minimalistic, good dark music, reminiscent of Subterrain game. The menu immediately reminded me of the Darkest Dungeon production. The game quickly introduces the fight. Opponents have relatively large hitboxes which makes it easy to aim at enemies and quickly turn them into red slush. It surprised me, it seems easy with single enemies, but the level of difficulty changes dramatically when you have to deal with hordes of enemies. Here, more powerful weapons come in handy and you can choose from a large arsenal. I like the approach to the character development tree. You can choose one of two ways for each of the weapons, which encourages to repeat the production and try all available builds. The game is well optimized. It is easy to play on 12-year-old hardware. Also, an average laptop is enough to play the game.

The shooting is slick, the enemies are memorable, the levels are fun to explore and go through, and the soundtrack is absolutely KILLER.That being said, Act 5 (probably the final act) feels VERY unpolished compared to the rest of the campaign. While the levels themselves are beautiful, the encounters don't feel as tune: constantly starved for resources, the enemies are too tanky, they move too quickly, and shoot entirely too many projectiles. I had to bump it down to the Easiest difficulty and I am STILL struggling.I am by no means great at shooters, but going from one Act to the next shouldn't feel like a massive escalation in difficulty, it should be more gradual."}], "game_id": "1590910", "game_title": "Forgive_Me_Father"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "iamzachhunter", "comment": "Lego Star Wars I/II/III/Complete Saga were four of my favorite video games as a young lad. I pre-ordered The Skywalker Saga a few days before its release; and at 100 hours of the game played, all 9 episodes completed, and 900 Kyber Bricks collected, I feel I can give an informed review. I will be judging the game on individual metrics, and then I'll give my final score.Exploration - 10/10If I could only mention one aspect of this game at exceeded my expectations, it would certainly be the vast galaxy laden with puzzles, side missions, and collectibles. I would hazard a guess that the average player will spend upwards of 200 hours achieving 100% completion of this game. The developers give the player the freedom to explore hub worlds immediately after discovering the planet; this allowed me to take frequent breaks from the episodic story to pursue all of the hidden collectibles throughout the worlds. In my opinion, the most fun part of this game is exploring the hub worlds. It is a completionist's paradise.Progression - 7/10I really appreciate when developers put time into erecting a progression system in their game - especially in an open-world genre; this allows players to work towards an eventual goal as they complete missions. In the early game, I looked forward to acquiring faster sprint speeds and stud magnet ranges. Later, I looked closer at the class-specific abilities and started investing in the Bounty Hunter and Dark Jedi. I wasn't expecting much in the way of a progression system from this game and was pleasantly surprised when I learned one was implemented. That said, I can't score the game too highly as I feel that most of the abilities are not particularly impressive. Once I had collected 500 Kyber Bricks, I was able to unlock all of the useful abilities, after which my interest in collecting more Kyber Bricks diminished. I still fully intend on obtaining all 1166, but the short-term rewards are lackluster at this point.Story - 3/10I must say the story missions in this game were a chore to play. I started off with the Phantom Menace and quickly learned that the enjoyable part of the game was exploring the hub worlds, not advancing through the tediously scripted missions. I felt like for almost the entire story mode, I was traveling between checkpoints as main characters spouted the dialogue from the movies, switching classes to interact with the same darn button puzzles, or engaging in \"intense\" light-saber combat with the bosses. I was told the combat system in this game was to be more advanced, and while it technically is more complex than the original Lego Star Wars games, the developers gave up on the puzzles integrated with the boss fights. It is simply a slashing fest for five minutes for every boss: Maul, Dooku, Grievous, Anakin, Vader, Sidious, Kylo, etc. In most boss fights, once the boss reaches a certain threshold, they will run away; and it usually takes several minutes to catch up with them. This really breaks the urgency of combat. And this often occurs 2-3 times per boss. The space combat is much more enjoyable as there are no breaks in combat. You simply search and destroy the given targets until the mission is over. Luckily, there are other aspects of this game that make up for the missions' shortcomings.Movies - 9/10So glad to see that the wit of Lego games as persisted all of these years. There were many occasions I audibly laughed at the humor throughout the movies in this game. My only complaint is that you cannot access the movies anywhere in the menus. In previous installments, you could purchase and watch the movies in the shop at your leisure. It made it difficult to share funny moments with my friends/family, as I would have to find a clip on YouTube of the scene I was on just to show it.Performance - 8/10As this game has just released, I am going to cut it some slack on occasional bugs I encountered throughout playing it. I experienced only one crash in the entire game - when I attempted to equip the Shore Trooper character in my first hour of game play. The only serious bug I repeatedly encountered is the Trade Federation Battleship occupying the center of space battles when it wasn't supposed to be there. It had no substance, so it was still possible to complete the missions. Graphically, the game is beautiful. I never experienced frame drops at 3840/2160p 60hertz. (RTX 3060ti) My one complaint with the graphical settings is the FOV status. I felt way too close to my character throughout this game. I would have appreciated an in-game setting to adjust this.Overall Rating - 37/50 or 74%I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the hub worlds in this game, solving all of the puzzles, collecting all of the Kyber Bricks and Data Cards, unlocking all of the characters. To supplement the boredom of the story missions, I listened to Ben Shapiro podcasts while I played with the sound off. I wouldn't say this lives up to the glories of The Complete Saga, but did anyone actually thought it could be that good? No, I don't think so. But this game still is a lot of fun a deserves the attention that any Lego Game gets.Final RecommendationsStart with Episode 7 and unlock the scavenger items as Rey. You get them early on, and multiple puzzles require them to be completed. You don't have to finish episode 7. Just get the gear and jump back to one of the good trilogies. Don't try to 100% every hub world immediately, some Kyber Bricks and Characters can only be obtained after completing a side mission that is started on another planet. Once you've obtained all of the Kyber Bricks visible on the map, you've done all you can do for the time. Also, make sure to check inside interiors on the map. Kyber Bricks do not appear on the tracker until you're in the building."}, {"username": "dggravd", "comment": "the zam wesell chase in ep2 is just as cancerous as in the original10/10"}, {"username": "⛧ Animosity ⛧", "comment": "A perfect example of what a \"remake\" of an old masterpiece should be, improvement in almost every aspect of the game, truly felt like a kid again."}, {"username": "Zebus", "comment": "my anxiety for mini kit searching resurfaces"}, {"username": "cj19202", "comment": "The most fun lego game ever, there's so much content, so much nostalgia it's insane, so many worlds you can explore, so much you can do.

The levels were long, the combat was too easy and really the only thing that the original game had going for it was the sheer amount of unlockables.This game fixes almost everything that's been wrong with the lego games, the combat is fun with a new combo system and lightsaber throwing, movement feels good, there's a free third person camera, the graphics are beautiful, and it doesn't ask for hours and hours of your time per session. The way they tell the story in this game is just like the older game, it's quick and only touches on what it really needs to. There are so many collectibles in this game and I've been having a good time going around collecting them all, most require you to switch to a specific character type, or solve cute well designed puzzles :)There are a few criticisms I have concerning the flow of the gameplay loop mainly in the prequel episodes, it feels like episode one and two specifically never leave you alone to explore. It was overwhelming, it asks you to travel to a new area what feels like every five minutes leaving you no room to breathe. While I like the fast progression of story in this game, for some reason it just goes WAY too fast in the prequels.The one other thing that's a little lame is that there are 'puzzles' where you walk up to a device with a specific character and perform a series of actions to open a door or power something. These are never built upon, it's always the same throughout the entire game and they feel arbitrarily placed around the game with no rhyme or reason. But honestly that's where the bad stuff ends.Finally, do not play this game in fullscreen. Play in borderless windowed. This game does not want you to tab out and trying to tab back in after doing so will either result in the game being scaled down to 800x600 and you having to set it back or the game just not focusing again. you have been warned.Overall this game has been a blast so far and i'm excited to keep going. It brings back the same emotions I felt when playing the original as a kid and sometimes i find myself smiling at just how immersed i am in a silly lego game :) There are a few poor trends this game follows but they don't outweigh the pros at all. play this one"}, {"username": "hyperweasle", "comment": "TLDR: Game is fun, but not worth full price. Wait for a discount.This is the type of game that makes me I wish Steam had a in between rating. So um, I will say I recommend it, but not at full price. The problem is that it's downgrade in alot of ways to the complete saga, for instance the hub world NPCs only have like two actions, walk and run away if attacked. At first I was ok with it since they were all defenseless citizens. That was until I realized almost every NPC in the hub areas are like that including Clone Troopers. Yes, the Republic's finest on Coruscant will run away at the first sight of danger. There are few exceptions where I came across some Storm Troopers in Cloud City, but that is rare sight. Not only that, but if you switch to a Dark Side character, the hub NPCs, other than a select few, will not react to you any differently, nor can you use dark side abilities on them. Sadly this game also suffers from game breaking bugs as well, which may have been fixed in patches, but I had problems with indefinite black screens during transitions causing me to restart the game again. Along with performance issues that cause the game to dip to down to 40 fps on a RTX 2060 and Ryzen 7 5800x. The graphics are improved, but not by that much that it should be causing performance in selects areas to go below 60 fps, even lower the settings does very little to help with it.The best change is the player combat and boss battles which I do feel are improved over the complete saga. Having the ability to use combos to earn studs, to aim a blaster and light saber throw, and use the force to manipulable objects in any direction you want is really good.Lastly the custom characters are removed which wouldn't have been a huge deal if the game was well refined, but it's not. The game itself lack so much polish that I really have a hard time forgiving removing such a key feature that was present in all other Lego games go back all the way to Lego Star Wars II while lacking the polish of those game. Keep in mind this isn't even the first open world Lego game, the DC and Marvel Lego games are also open world and have so much more polish and more interesting NPCs in the hub areas, which makes me wonder where all the development went into on this game, I can't imagine the player characters took so much effort to improve that all other aspects of the game suffered."}], "game_id": "920210", "game_title": "LEGO_Star_Wars_The_Skywalker_Saga"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "iamzachhunter", "comment": "Lego Star Wars I/II/III/Complete Saga were four of my favorite video games as a young lad.

You simply search and destroy the given targets until the mission is over. Luckily, there are other aspects of this game that make up for the missions' shortcomings.Movies - 9/10So glad to see that the wit of Lego games as persisted all of these years. There were many occasions I audibly laughed at the humor throughout the movies in this game. My only complaint is that you cannot access the movies anywhere in the menus. In previous installments, you could purchase and watch the movies in the shop at your leisure. It made it difficult to share funny moments with my friends/family, as I would have to find a clip on YouTube of the scene I was on just to show it.Performance - 8/10As this game has just released, I am going to cut it some slack on occasional bugs I encountered throughout playing it. I experienced only one crash in the entire game - when I attempted to equip the Shore Trooper character in my first hour of game play. The only serious bug I repeatedly encountered is the Trade Federation Battleship occupying the center of space battles when it wasn't supposed to be there. It had no substance, so it was still possible to complete the missions. Graphically, the game is beautiful. I never experienced frame drops at 3840/2160p 60hertz. (RTX 3060ti) My one complaint with the graphical settings is the FOV status. I felt way too close to my character throughout this game. I would have appreciated an in-game setting to adjust this.Overall Rating - 37/50 or 74%I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the hub worlds in this game, solving all of the puzzles, collecting all of the Kyber Bricks and Data Cards, unlocking all of the characters. To supplement the boredom of the story missions, I listened to Ben Shapiro podcasts while I played with the sound off. I wouldn't say this lives up to the glories of The Complete Saga, but did anyone actually thought it could be that good? No, I don't think so. But this game still is a lot of fun a deserves the attention that any Lego Game gets.Final RecommendationsStart with Episode 7 and unlock the scavenger items as Rey. You get them early on, and multiple puzzles require them to be completed. You don't have to finish episode 7. Just get the gear and jump back to one of the good trilogies. Don't try to 100% every hub world immediately, some Kyber Bricks and Characters can only be obtained after completing a side mission that is started on another planet. Once you've obtained all of the Kyber Bricks visible on the map, you've done all you can do for the time. Also, make sure to check inside interiors on the map. Kyber Bricks do not appear on the tracker until you're in the building."}, {"username": "dggravd", "comment": "the zam wesell chase in ep2 is just as cancerous as in the original10/10"}, {"username": "Zebus", "comment": "my anxiety for mini kit searching resurfaces"}, {"username": "⛧ Animosity ⛧", "comment": "A perfect example of what a \"remake\" of an old masterpiece should be, improvement in almost every aspect of the game, truly felt like a kid again."}, {"username": "Albus DumbleDank", "comment": "This game is great not just for the men, but the women and the children as well"}, {"username": "cj19202", "comment": "The most fun lego game ever, there's so much content, so much nostalgia it's insane, so many worlds you can explore, so much you can do.

The levels were long, the combat was too easy and really the only thing that the original game had going for it was the sheer amount of unlockables.This game fixes almost everything that's been wrong with the lego games, the combat is fun with a new combo system and lightsaber throwing, movement feels good, there's a free third person camera, the graphics are beautiful, and it doesn't ask for hours and hours of your time per session. The way they tell the story in this game is just like the older game, it's quick and only touches on what it really needs to. There are so many collectibles in this game and I've been having a good time going around collecting them all, most require you to switch to a specific character type, or solve cute well designed puzzles :)There are a few criticisms I have concerning the flow of the gameplay loop mainly in the prequel episodes, it feels like episode one and two specifically never leave you alone to explore. It was overwhelming, it asks you to travel to a new area what feels like every five minutes leaving you no room to breathe. While I like the fast progression of story in this game, for some reason it just goes WAY too fast in the prequels.The one other thing that's a little lame is that there are 'puzzles' where you walk up to a device with a specific character and perform a series of actions to open a door or power something. These are never built upon, it's always the same throughout the entire game and they feel arbitrarily placed around the game with no rhyme or reason. But honestly that's where the bad stuff ends.Finally, do not play this game in fullscreen. Play in borderless windowed. This game does not want you to tab out and trying to tab back in after doing so will either result in the game being scaled down to 800x600 and you having to set it back or the game just not focusing again. you have been warned.Overall this game has been a blast so far and i'm excited to keep going. It brings back the same emotions I felt when playing the original as a kid and sometimes i find myself smiling at just how immersed i am in a silly lego game :) There are a few poor trends this game follows but they don't outweigh the pros at all. play this one"}], "game_id": "920210", "game_title": "LEGO_Star_Wars_The_Skywalker_Saga"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "Breadmanningtonlll", "comment": "I genuinely think this game is incredible, however at the moment there are some issues. One of the biggest issues is that the hunters are able to shoot everything wildly with zero consequences, making the use of devices to help locate the ghosts next to useless and making hiding as the ghosts more difficult since blending in doesn't matter if the hunters can shoot everything they want. I feel like the implementation of an actual ammo system instead of infinite ammo could help alleviate this issue as the way it stands currently doesn't seem to be the way the creators intended for the game to be played. The addition of an ammo system in my eyes would make each shot more deliberate, and if the hunters run out they'll have to rely on the melee weapons instead (which I never see players use so I feel like this will make those weapons more worth while) other than that I haven't run into any other issues.

This shouldnt be a thing. cold blooded should work as anyone would want it.

Even with the default perk for further distances still seems too short regardlessProp speeds regardless of size is laughable because most hunters use lightweight anyways and you will never get away without the proper ghost type or abilities. even hunters without lightweight still can catch up with any prop with ease.Allowing hunters to use same gadgets as each other has resulted in a lot of trap spammingHost rage quitting matches does not migrate to a new host.Quick play keeps joining ending matches or already started matches resulting in a quick GHOST death because you late spawned and couldnt hide.As we wait for a first patch to be released I hope ghosts get more love as it is predominately hunter favored.Dont get me wrong, im expressing my concerns as a common player feels there is an imbalance.

You do very little waiting around like you would in a normal prop hunt game because the hunters have a lot of tools at their disposal to weed you out as a ghost.If you are not good at FPS, I would not pick this up. And if you are not comfortable with super-competitive players having this game down to a science (i.e. knowing the best props to possess, knowing which combo works best with their friends, etc.) I would also not pick this up. There's no competitive v casual queue, so you go up against some REALLY aggressive players who want to win at all costs.If you are the competitive type and are willing to learn the meta stuff, by all means grab it. I just don't think I'm a fan just yet with the shape the game is in. I also don't really care for the model of unlocking tools/weapons/perks that should be available from the get-go.

{"username": "DYNAMIC skills7", "comment": "its a fun game with friends and to try out fresh with everyone, but if you get it too late there will be nothing but tryhards and a lot of presented gameplay potential with various abilities and fun thrown out the window because their made useless with metas and the unending power of hunters making the game bland and boring in the end. best played in friend groups. heres some of the balance issues with ghosts below and the general flow of matches.the main issue is getting found too easily and being unable to escape. i suspect the harpoon nerf and slight movement change will not fix this. one issue is the hunters ability to spot. which applies a wall hacks to the props. this completely negates 2 abilities called phantom and miasma. escape potential is ruined. phantom which gives temporary invisibility, is instead used for movement based hiding to avoid an equipment called pathfinder to a degree, which tracks footprints and miasma being a slow damage applying mist has no noticeable effect against me as a hunter or ghost using it.ghosts are very punished for working hard to get 1 kill early. a hunter could be alone and you manage to get the jump on him and barely survive to consume him, maybe losing a teammate in the process and then the other 3 just kill you and revive him. not getting killed to prevent the enemy revive option is a tough order when 3 others can never lose track of you for the whole match and they generally have enough time to make it to him. hunters who split up should be punished in my opinion because it gives the ghosts a weakness to work with and helps the hiding slightly. the current balance makes sense on paper because ghost can revive too, but were talking about 2 different sides here that need their own balance. i think when a ghosts consumes someone they should have a time limit until their back or only come back at midnight as backup. splitting up is rare anyway as comp teams should always be coordinating equipment mostly in teams of 2. hunters hp can not always be seen either so you dont know what to do with them and the safest logical option is attempting escape. instead of limiting options, players should be punished for bad health management too, but the bar is hidden making it a gamble!. making deaths actually matter for hunters i feel is a great dynamic added to the match and feels much more rewarding. but alas such a thing doesnt exist.hunters counter literally every play style a ghost can have.spirit which lets you fly is countered by damaging the spirit form which i assume burning hard counters too.doppelganger letting you take the form of a hunter is very noticeable in a comms team and in small groups of 2 splitting up and no one takes friendly fire.poltergeist which raises objects and then throws them when a hunter is close warns you its rising up from quite a distance away too and shooting it knocks them down. the main comp strat here would be to have a chased teammate run into a poltergeist room to escape, but theres multiple problems with this. hunters could be cutting the ghost off from the other side, the hunters can corner check the room, the hunters can run past floating objects and have them miss, the floating objects commonly deal 11 damage so it doesnt really matter and i dont know if this value can go up if furniture hits the head or hits at a closer distance.telekinesis which lets you throw a object at people after a charge up and careful aiming just alerts hunters of your nearby presence and is cancelled by shooting it again. also hard to hit on any hunter movement.trickster which lets you move a object buys 2 seconds of attention from a hunter and if theres 2+ youre not going to be using this power to pull any kind of escape.apparition which sends a dumb ai clone out on the same path is mostly a gamble. you could pretend to be a apparition to escape which wont work if shot and if used when hiding it just leads a trail of plasma straight to you and tells the hunters which direction youre in...deaths grip which traps hunters until they shoot it works great if a solo hunter is on the case but again useless with 2+ people chasing and getting pinged so they know where to catch up to.corrupter which puts a bomb on objects is pointless for shooters that know the explosion radius of this ability, but has the great addition of throwing off spectrphones that detect ghost presence, but why would anyone use a spectrophone when the radar detects you immediately at 0 plasma level, at decent ranges, and is not interfered by anything. this leads me to my next point.radars. ecoplasm which builds over time as you stay still hiding apparently gives your position away more. but is absolutely pointless and very dissatisfying to even try hiding now. you have a hunter equip radar at spawn with lightweight and he immediately starts speed running all the rooms to pick up even a fraction of a reading which can happen at even the smallest % of plasma and then he immediately pings the room and scours it to find and kill you. the range of the radar looks to be around 5 metres at very low ectoplasm which is still far too much.its ok to have some bad abilities in the game that could serve the purpose of being fun, but in this case theres nothing that definitively helps in the grand scheme of things while hunters have no where near as much weaknesses or competition. the meta seems to be a radar runner with a pathfinder and everyone running lightweight and their never gonna need a midnight build. if a ghost needs vaccuming to prevent revives 1 or 2 just go back to the store where they can change their equipment in game to get it. attacking the hunter store results in death if they expect you to try it too because of pathfinder and cutoffs for retreat. the dead ghosts leaving a fake trail is a gamble and lightweight lets people catch up again when ghosts chill them, slowing their speed for 2 seconds.i dont know how responsive the devs are but i havent seen many comments about these issues and the discord cant even be accessed. for me the link doesnt

Recommend to anyone that love exploration, crafting, surviving and building games. :D"}, {"username": "VengefulAncient", "comment": "An extremely addicting game. Tried the demo, got hooked, bought it. I really like what I'm seeing so far.Pros:- Addicting main gameplay loop. Hoard more resources, get more tech, expand your base, discover more wrecks, watch the planet bloom.- Terraforming progress as the main goal and simultaneously the replacement for research is a nice concept.- Tree and flower planters are pretty and make your base feel like a real home. So does the ability to turn every wall and ceiling/floor into a window.- 100% resource refund for every deconstructed or recycled item is a brilliant mechanic. Too many games get this wrong and stifle experimentation. In this game, you can build anything you have enough resources for, look at it, decide \"nah don't need this\", deconstruct it, and lose absolutely nothing. This also makes moving your base extremely simple, and plays great with the \"planned obsolescence\" mechanic - since there is zero incentive to keep lower-tier machines once you have access to higher-tier ones, the resources spent on building them are fully reclaimed instead of being tied up/lost forever.- The game is surprisingly good at always having you chase something without feeling like it's unattainable or making it scarce forever. The needs constantly evolve and change.Cons:- Performance. I've got a Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti and initially, I used to have nearly constant 120-144+ fps. I'm now at the trees stage and at my base it's routinely down to 30 fps, 20 if a meteor shower hits. My base isn't very big but has a lot of vegetation (about 12 flower planters around it and 12 tree planters not too far from it) which for me is one of the main appeals of the game, but it also feels like the biggest performance killer.- Object placement and alignment can be really wonky - some buildings' and objects' projections will be arbitrarily too far away from the camera and spazz out if you try to bring them closer. It doesn't happen too often or with everything, but when it does, it feels very frustrating.What I'd like to see:- Better rockets. While they look cool and the idea is great, with the exception of spawning uranium/iridium, it doesn't feel like they do anything to speed up terraforming, even though the game tells you they are important and claims 1000% bonuses on heat, pressure, etc. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how they work, but then it should be explained more clearly.- The blueprints screen does not show the biomass-locked blueprints at all - made me think that my game is bugged and a bunch of stuff I kept reading about in guides (like T1 tree planters) just didn't show up in my game. Would be nice to fix that.- More messages! The transmissions screen and the antenna it requires to function are quite an investment early on in the game, but you barely get anything out of it. The game would feel much more interesting and immersive if we just got more comments on our progress from both Sentinel and Riley. Never underestimate good old plain text!- That said, wrecks could use more messages describing what happened to them, too. And those that do need better indication that there's a working message screen - super easy to overlook while exploring.- Which brings me to the flashlight: it's outright claustrophobic and exploring with it makes me feel physically sick, it feels like some cheap torch from the 90s. While I get that exploring wrecks is meant to be hard, we should at least get a T2 with a wider beam.- A real map you can use at any time would be really nice. T3 GPS satellite/T2 compass chip?- Support platforms should really be the same size as base rooms and snap to them.- I'd love to be able to place *all* objects on a grid, not just lockers. Right now, placing food growers indoors results in messy uneven rows of them.- Currently, there's no way to remove windows or doors without deconstructing the whole room they're in. It would be nice to be able to remove them individually.- Maybe rovers? Going between ore extractors can be a chore even with T3 jetpack. Driving would at least make it more fun. Especially if rovers would provide oxygen and more space than a backpack!Overall, huge props to the developers for putting this out, it's a very fun game with lots of potential, and I hope it gets improved over time."}, {"username": "bearsic", "comment": "TL;DR: Game is about 10 hours of good paced content, then grinding. I hope the game developers use the cash injection to really work on this product to flesh it out further which could make this game really good. As others have said, try the demo, the demo is representative of the first 10 hours of play. It is similar in flavour of sub nautica. Do the calculation of 10 hours of good game for the price tag of your country and see if that is of good value, the demo is maybe the first 3-4 hours(the save carries over from demo to full game) EARLY GAMEPacing is good, feels good to travel around and explore, you only need a few of the machines and you just upgrade them as you unlock newer versions, which keeps progress going. Since its minimal management on that end, you can explore while the number ticks up. Exploration is alright, I will say some places can be very hard to find, as they can be just a tiny ladder in a corner, but all the main monuments are...pretty basic, go in, break barrier, take loot, go home. you go in and out maybe 3 times to collect all the loot. LATE GAMEWhen you get to around the 10 hour mark, you have unlocked all the terraforming equipment, at least most of it. at that point in the game you just unlocked something for like lets say 10,000 points, that means in 10 hours you generated 10,000 points, the next unlock is like 10,000,000 points, so it goes from a game of unlocking stuff and exploring into a game of 'okay time to get to work' and you just have to start crafting a bunch of the drills and heaters and such to start bumping all your numbers up. The problem with this is getting materials, right now to obtain the mid/late game materials, you have two options after draining the map of them, you 'summon' them from rockets, which you don't get a ton of the resources and its a manual process of going to go collect all the resources, it just isn't really 'fun' its just a chore, collect materials to build rocket, send rocket,wait for rocks, keep rough track of where they all land, go mine the rocks, repeat process. It also doesn't help that the rockets require the same resources that they are dropping, so if you collect 20 red ore, you have to use 6 to get another rocket, so you only really got 14, while spending maybe 30 minutes doing so.The alternative is ore drills, these would be great, if not for one flaw, you place this in specific areas to get specific materials, sounds great, put the ore drill in the red cave to get red ore, sounds easy enough. The problem is these ore miners have limited space, lets say like 15, now 15 of red ore would be great, the problem is the miners don't collect JUST the red ore, they collect maybe 1 red ore for every 4 'junk' ore and you are left with 3 red ore after it has mined for 10-20 minutes. These ore miners are not super easy to make, they take a long time to fill up, and they get filled with junk, but they are the only way to get some materials like aluminium, so you are forced to act like an errand boy, going from drill to drill, collecting resources, and dumping the junk ore into storage(or on the floor in a giant pile) This is a pretty annoying part of the game, but the good thing is, it is an easy fix from the developers. I want the drill to just drill what I need, If I want junk ore, I can put the drill in a 'common' area and get it that way, I don't want this mix of ores. To add onto this, because the drills have to be in specific areas, those areas are pretty far apart, even with max level jets and such, just going back and forward so many damn times, I've spent most my time doing just that.If the devs take the early access money, build up both the story more, the unlocks more and expand the exploration a bit more and maybe add a bit of teleporting so you aren't traveling so damn far to do things, this teleportation would also be good BEFORE the grind wall, so you can get to and from the drills and such easier.overall, try the demo, it made me want to buy the game, but if you are tight for money, maybe hold off another year."}, {"username": "DragonStryder", "comment": "Lovely game to just sit back, relax, explore, build and enjoy. very stable for an Early Access game. quite some content as well."}, {"username": "LYS", "comment": "finally, a normal human developed game, aiding your customer, good, i appreiated that."}, {"username": "[UN] Simon", "comment": "Very atmospheric, graphically beautiful and immersive game.

Jet-packing between my multiple miners to grab resources (which frustratingly produce multiple other junk resources making this a longer process), to produce things while there is no threat to me/no survival aspect.

What worries me too is that the developers are planning on extending this portion of the game (making amphibians, insects, etc.) but there is no puzzle, no chance of failure, just plug in hours and get said answer.The initial thrill of the game came from the challenging survival, short lengths of time you can survive outside, prioritising the way through the puzzle with the interesting story. But more needs to be done to make the second phase more interesting because sadly it is slightly boring due to the repetitiveness."}, {"username": "humi", "comment": "A really good lofi collect and craft game.

It is set in modern Tokyo; however, it comes with a major twist. Every single human disappears at the start of the game, leaving just their spirits behind. It is up to Akito who manages to survive with the help of a mysterious spirit calling himself KK. Thanks to him, Akito gains new supernatural powers needed to save both his sister from the clutches of Hannya as well as safe the city.Horrors UnleashedOn your journey through yokai-infested streets of Tokyo, you will meet various adversaries, called Visitors. These are pulled straight from Japanese folklore and urban legends. The most basic enemy, Rain Walker, is born because its human predecessor was drive to exhaustion by their work. And thus, in revenge, they drain life force from living and breathing humans. Every single enemy has a short backstory like this in the game, making you feel even more immersed. To face these evil entities, you are given your own arsenal of supernatural powers thank to KK’s ties to the spirit world. You have three basic abilities you unlock early on, each useful for different situations. There is the rapid-fire wind, explosive fire, and close-range water, each with their own supply of “ammunition”, which you replenish by breaking surrounding spirit objects. This whole set up forces you to be mobile in combat and never stand for too long in one spot otherwise you either risk being swarmed by enemies or running out of ammo. As there are ways to deal damage, there are some for avoiding damage. You can either dodge aside by simply moving or block the incoming attack. With precise timing, you can even get a perfect block, which negates all the damage. From personal experience, I can say that moving around is way more effective and safer than trying to block attacks coming from all sides. If you, however, do manage to get hit, do not fret. There is a hefty amount of healing items. Regular food not only heals you but also increases your overall max health, so eating is advised. Otherworldly food items give you temporary buffs to your skills or stats that diminish over time.On top of that, as you progress through the game, you will gain access to supportive talismans, which are one-use items that replace stereotypical FPS grenades. There are 4 distinctive types, again each useable in different scenario. Two of them are made for loud combat and two of them will make stealth easier. On topic of stealth, you have a few tools up your sleeve if you are a kind of player who enjoys sticking to the shadows and backstabbing everything alive. You can either get close and personal behind a Visitor, getting an easy kill (unless they are a tougher enemy or a boss) or use your trusty bow to snipe them from afar. The choice is ultimately up to you as well as is the playstyle. Collectathon in my open-world?!Ghostwire is not afraid to show its huge amount of collectable content within the game.  You have 240 thousand spirits to liberate, found in bunches ranging from 100 to 700. That is a lot of souls to save. You can get the spirits as quest rewards, find them in the open-world or through wave-based fights. All of these are collected by using katashiro (paper dolls), which cap at 50 and you start only with ten so get to upgrading them as fast as possible. After you get done with the spirits, there is a lot of relics for you to gather. Luckily, each of the collectors will mark the approximate location on the map if you tag in their respective shops, making it just a quick fetch quest for a decent amount of money and new unlocks when certain number of requests for each individual shopkeeper has been completed.So, you gather up all the relics and think for yourself that you are already done. Then you remember that a speaking tanuki gave you a quest to find 25 of his disguised friends. Those 25 tanukis transformed into everything ranging from billboards to cup of noodles. Luckily each of them has a tail sticking out, making them recognizable.You also have numerous magatamas either in shops or in form of yokai, who each have a different mini task attached to them. If you want to unlock every single skill in the game, you need to get all of them.On top of that you have outfits as well as music that can be played at any point in the game, making the exploration feel a bit more epic.In summary, massive chunk of content is collecting these items, so if you are not fan of gathering items and just running around the city, looking for all kinds of weird items, be vary. Why is this not Dying Light?Simple answer is lack of parkour moves. This game has jump button, simple climbing mechanics for getting on top of ledges, grappling hook and the ability to glide. To be completely objective here, the movement in Ghostwire does not feel nowhere as refined as in Dying Light. The climbing is often clunky and grabbing onto ledges changes into spamming spacebar after jumping. The fully upgraded grappling hook has unclear grapple points and again will result into you holding right click and mashing spacebar while aiming at the roof of a building to make sure you can grapple there. You simple cannot use the hook ability anywhere you wish to.However, this moveset is enough for you to make the exploration enjoyable. It was fun to glide across the Shibuya district with the tunes from the in-game musical player. Even with the rather simplistic mechanics, it was fun gathering up every single collectable. But do not expect the free-form movement that Dying Light offers.Akito + KK=BromanceThe duo of Akito and KK carried the story heavily. Their relationship that simply starts as KK being a parasite, sitting in Akito’s body developed into a closely tied friendship, where everything depends on utmost trust. I loved every single interaction between those two and was excited to see what new shenanigans the pair will bring to my screen. This was crucial as the overall narrative is very simplistic in nature. Evil man steals your sister and wants to connect the underworld with the human world. Normal Japanese anime stuff. Luckily for you, the main duo is stunning and almost never gets dull. If we exclude the repeated voice lines when it comes to side content. The same cannot be said about the supporting cast, which there is a few of. You do not get to know them a lot and it feels like they were placed in the game just it would not just be Akito and KK trying to stop Hannya’s evil schemes. Both Reiko and Ed, the rest of KK’s team are also spirits. Ed only talks through voice recordings when using the phone, whereas Reiko gets a bit of a screen time. Sadly, both characters are massively under-developed and feel like a fluff so the story would not feel entirely empty.Killing ghosts is easyAs with any game that has levels and character progression, if you do all the side content first, you will be massively overpowered. That made the end game bosses ridiculously easy. Don’t get me wrong, each of the major bosses has a unique and terrifying design with unique mechanics. However, those do not matter as you become a literal god amongst ghosts. That is my biggest issue with the game. I wish there would be any scaling in place or at least recommended levels for both the main quests and side-quests. EpitaphIf you are not afraid of doing a bit of leg work collecting things while battling supernatural entities, grab this game right away.

It is quite simply one of the best maps I've ever seen in a videogame.But that's where the good things end. This is a game entirely carried by its environment. The combat is underdeveloped and gets dull quickly, there's barely any enemy variety, the open world activities are basically a bunch of ubisoft tier collectathons, and the story feels like a complete afterthought with how uninteresting it is.It feels like what happened here is that they made the map and then realized they had to make a game around it, so they scrambled to fill it up with content and shipped it as soon as possible. This is a rushed product, not in the usual sense of being buggy, but in the sense that its core concepts haven't been developed enough.I'd love to see Ghostwire becoming a series that takes us to different places across the world with their local environment und culture on display, but before that can happen, Tango Gameworks has to sit down and rework the mechanics of Ghostwire. Make the combat deep and engaging beyond some sparkly animations. Give us a great range of different enemies that we actually have to approach differently from each other. Invest time into making a compelling story with interesting characters. And make open-world content that makes the exploration of your beautiful worlds even more fun rather than less so. Ghostwire has alot of potential and can become a great game series, but as it currently stands it's not there yet. Final verdict: great map, mediocre gameplay. 5/10Buy it if you want to walk through Shibuya, but otherwise your time and money is better spent elsewhere."}, {"username": "Omega Bard", "comment": "This is more of a Maybe, but you know steam.At it's core, it's a beautiful and well polished game, with enjoyable combat, an amazing atmosphere, and a lot of unique ideas.  It focuses around Japanese folklore, which normally I don't care about, but it makes each new discovery interesting.  It then adds on a huge amount of collectibles of various types, randomly hidden all throughout the city, which improve your character in some way - which can be discouraging for some, but I found it engagingUnfortunately, that's part of the problem; I did a lot of the sidequests, and collected a lot of things.  I'm now 8 hours in and have fully upgraded all my combat abilities, and I don't think there's really anywhere left to go.  This is what combat is going to be like for the next 30 hours or so.  Which is sorta fine, because it's still enjoyable, but I'm not sure it will be enjoyable 30 hours later.  Otherwise, many of the quests are also very hollow; they exist only to show you some creature from folklore, and then you hold down the 'absorb power' button and it dies and you get a reward.The rewards also stop feeling rewarding when you see that after 8 hours of meticulously grabbing every one you find, you're at 20,000/250,000 And speaking of finding things - you get an ability with no cooldown, that lets you see any interactable object, or enemy, through walls in any direction, for quite a long distance.  This makes the collectible business trivial and tedious; every few steps you stop, press the hotkey, look around/up/down/everywhere, try to figure out if any of the dozen outlines currently being shown are anything useful, move forward a few more steps, repeatSo, it's a maybe for me.  I still plan to keep going with it, and just avoid/ignore the collectibles, and see how it all plays out.  And on its surface, it really does look and feel great.

They team up to kick ass and reverse the separation and put everyone back into their bodies. It's a very quick story to get through and the ending got me super emotional.

It really made me feel like a kid again, just learning to play video games. The fact that you can't read most of the in-game stuff just adds to that, since when I was too young and/or stupid to be able to read when I first started playing video games. Similar to the original Legend of Zelda, this game doesn't give you any notion as to where to go/what to do at the start. Finding pages of the old school instruction booklet is a very nice touch, and a great way to slowly give you an idea of what's going on in the game.The combat is pretty fun and engaging. Lots of dodge-rolling with some i-frames and plays very similar to Dark Souls, just with an isometric camera. Useful spells to discover, upgrades for stats, all that jazz.I don't know if the game includes puzzles to solve, or if the entire game itself is the puzzle. It can be difficult to figure out where to go/what to do next at times. Many times even after I've figured out where to go, it's another matter entirely to figure out how to get there. Lots of hidden pathways and cool shortcuts to discover.

In short, it is a creature collector JRPG with 1v1 (mostly, there are rare, but sometimes occurring 1v2 and 1v3, also I'm not taking into account PvP) turn-based battles. Coromon is, obviously, inspired by Pokemon, but if I had to say, it is inspired most of all by more older versions of Pokemon, like Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald.There are more than 100 (114 according to Corodex, however, due to specifics of some Coromon that I'll refrain from spoiling, I'd just say that there are over 100 of them) Coromon. Some have 3 stages of evolution, some just 2, nothing genre-breaking or game-redefining. There's no breeding, or different branches of evolution, so Coromon're all about just catching. There are 3 variations of each. Standard, Potent and Perfect. If you'd thought of Shinies, you are correct, as well as not.Standard Coromon appear 97.09% of the time (3101 to 3194), Potent 2.88% (92 to 3194) and Perfect 0.03% (1 to 3194). There's a Potency scale, which defines which one of the three they are. 1 to 16 Potency are Standard, 17 to 20 are Potent, and 21, which is a maximum of Potency, are Perfect. Potency defines how much XP you need before you'll receive 3 free stat points for a Coromon. The more Potency, the less XP is needed to acquire them. Basically, it's like additional level ups that go hand-in-hand with your usual XP progression. That means that unlike purely-cosmetic Shinies, Perfects can be stronger than their Standard counterparts. You may think of those free points as EV (Effort Values), even though that is not entirely true. For PvE it doesn't mean much, however if you're into that, stat changes will be noticeable and will make your creatures stronger, especially later on.There is a major flaw of this game, and it is it's oldschoolity in some of the design. I'm talking about unskippable/slow animations, strange inventory/menu management, long, unneeded transitions. I've spent 24 hours of the game for 3 first sections of it and then I've given up. I didn't want to speed up the game, but I just couldn't bear it. I've beat last 3 sections of the game in 6 hours. x4 times faster than first half of the game. And I didn't skip content, I've still collected all the Coromon, looted everything, seen the map, etc.I liked the animations, they are really awesome, as well as Coromon's visuals. However, I really don't want to spend this much time watching the same animations happen a thousand time. You cannot speed them up via game settings, skip is out of question as well. I honestly recommend getting used to the game at it's usual speed, watching those sweet attack animations and such, and when you are used to the gameplay loop and are able to respond to enemies' attacks accordingly, just speed it up. If I would've completed the same game in, let's say, 15 hours, instead of 30, I would've been really happy with it. Now, I really do grieve over so much time spent on weird management and needlessly prolonged battles. Though I still did enjoy the game.Thank you for reading, I hope you'll enjoy Coromon with or without the need to use a cheat engine or such."}, {"username": "Kaiserin", "comment": "why tf is flappy bird needed to progress in the storyline"}, {"username": "Arck", "comment": "Pros: Old school mon clone.

Coromon is basically the equivalent of early Pokemon made with more modern game design. It's clearly a passion project, and it's a lot of fun.Pros:* Bad puns* Efficient mon storage (easily sort by type)* Fairly simple typing system, no need to re-learn most things (Water beats Fire and Ground, for example. Ice beats Water, but that kind of makes sense.)* Good amount of RNG (critical hits, evasion, attacks that hit 1-3 times... sometimes it's nice to have to react when your plan doesn't quite work out.)* Customized bonus stat allocation. The equivalent of Pokemon's EVs, but you don't need to carefully track which enemies you're fighting. You want a max defense crab? Just put those points in defense. Want a glass cannon? Easy as pie.* Quests with a quest log.* Locations on map show which monsters are in the area, and which you have yet to catch.* Potency system. Potency (think IVs) gives you a 1:30 chance of encountering a semi-shiny mon, with a unique color and very good stats. In addition you have a 1:3000 chance of encountering a shiny mon with perfect stats. The semi-shinies are great for me as someone who loves collecting and finding rare things, but doesn't have the patience to hunt for perfect mons.* Customizable difficulty settings. You can have your mons auto-heal after each battle, make shop items cheaper; you can remove the option to escape battles, or have your mons disappear if they faint; and many more. Choose the options you want.Cons:* Some annoying minigames. (My suggestion to the developers: add an auto-bypass if you fail at them a few times. No one's buying this to play Flappy Bird.)* Puns have gone down in quantity since the first few hours of the game. I'm very sad about this.* No dual types* Battle UI doesn't show if you've caught a mon yet. It'd be very nice to easily see a spinner icon next to the monster name, for example.* Little information available on the Wiki, as of the time of writing this review.* Lots of RNG. Sometimes your best plan will fail a 90% chance three times in a row. (if you hate RNG, take a look at Temtem)"}, {"username": "Mu Shu Fasa", "comment": "This game is almost fun, it copies pokemon a bit too closely though. By that I mean coromon also copies the bad things about old pokemon games (many of which have been changed in more recent generations or more recent creature collector titles). For example:1. Way too many RNG mechanics for it ever to be interesting competitively (hax/ crits/ broken weather effects/ etc). Even in single player, RNG mechanics are neither satisfying to win with, nor do they feel fair to lose to.2. Poor balance: some types are just objectively worse (more weaknesses, fewer resists, resisted by more types/ fewer types they can hit with stab). E.g. fire gets doubly screwed over bc not only is it net 0 on the resist chart, it has no weather effect, and for some reason rain is the only weather effect in the game that lowers another types dmg (that type being fire). Sand on the other hand has great weather effect, only 1 weakness and 3 resists lul. 3. Too much grind: -I have given up on trying to find perfects/ potents of the mons I want, and likewise have given up on pvp bc it just seems like the barrier of entry is wayyyy to high to make an optimized team. -The berry planting mechanic is incredibly tedious, I don't want to have to write down where I planted what and run around to 50 different locations to gather them back up and replant. Not a fun gameplay loop. -The gem digging mini game to farm gold is equally unfun4. I don't understand the decision to make all mons monotype, it's feels so watered down from typical creature collector team building bc of this. Monotypes only also worsens the issue of imbalanced typings mentioned above.5. Lack of QOL features:-TM's are not reusable which means I end up never using them at all bc I'm afraid to waste them-No way to re-order your skills-As many others have mentioned, there are too many mandatory puzzles and mini games (for my personal preference). Many of which seem to adhere to the design philosophy seen throughout other aspects of the game: tedium over difficulty/ depth.Overall it's not a bad game its just frustrating bc it could be a hell of a lot better, I'd rate it about a 6/10 in its present state. I didn't list the positives the game has going for it bc there are plenty of positive reviews doing just that. Give it a try if you really like old school pokemon and don't mind all the poor game design features of those gens that have since been phased out of more modern titles."}, {"username": "Dust", "comment": "Playthrough in ProgressUpdate: This is not a pokemon-like game, this is a game of minigames and puzzles disguised as a pokemon-like. I would say 60%+ of the game is just doing puzzles and minigames. Not sure I'm going to bother completing it with how little and tedious the battling is compared to the amount of puzzles and minigames.None of them are particularly hard, its just really tedious.==Original Review==TLDR: Quality game, haven’t encountered any bugs and is stable so far. Has tons of feature for min-maxers for tweak their coromon. This game definitely seems aimed at those sorts rather than a chill pokemon-like game, very tedious so far.Why it’s tedious: Entirely linear, no exploration or multiple areas to train in. No secrets to be found, or side routes to be explored. Would be less of an issue if it wasn’t so grindy.Lots of puzzles – Battling often does feel like it takes a back seat to many puzzles.Excessive number of wild encounters, even when using repellent~Useful when grinding, a pain when just trying to travel. Excessive mandatory trainers blocking your paths~The equivalents of Gyms are huge and have a Gyms worth of trainers on each floor. Only thing making it bearable is I enabled regen on level up and half price shops. Otherwise I would regularly be out of items and have to backtrack to healing centers.Excessive Grinding: Even a 2-3 level difference will lead to bosses stomping your coromon, even when of an opposing type. And the excessive encounters above are still insufficient to have you at proper level by the time you reach a boss. So you’re stuck leveling in the single zones per level range."}, {"username": "JennDjinn", "comment": "Video review: https://youtu.be/4qrQbw2ENZQCoromon scratches the itch of classic Pokemon games!And while it stays true to the core gameplay,it also adds some nice features.* Great world & monster design* Challenging boss fights* About 120 Coromon* Catchy soundtrack* Loads of customization* Numerous Quality of Life features* Many different mini-games(some of which are frustrating)Turn-based combat similar to Pokemonbut with some interesting variations:* 2nd XP bar: add points to individual stats* There are standard, potent and perfect Coromon* Potent and perfect Coromon are always superior* Coromon never forget a move they learned* Each move costs SP, so there’s no PP limit"}, {"username": "IronHeaver", "comment": "I'm really glad to see more people taking a crack at the monster catching games and Coromon is a welcome breath of fresh air in a genre joined at the hip with Pokemon. As much as Id like to judge it solely on its own merits the comparison is hard to ignore but that's to be expected when competing with the largest franchise on Earth.  The Good 1. Creature Design: Coromon seems really dedicated to creating monsters that largely feel like they fit into a living breathing world, something that Pokemon seems to have less and less interest in. While I don't mind things like objectmons (Voltorb, Vanillish), I really can't stand ones that look like a Halloween costume or just set characters rather then a species of creature (Inteleon, Incineroar). Coromon's design focus leans into things that resemble functional animals for the most part with some deviations into the supernatural or technological, and its a solid design decision I hope they stick too. I should also mention that the sprite work in general is excellent. 2.Stamina as a Resource: Coromon's battle system sets it apart from pokemon while opening the door to new strategic options and potentially keeping weaker moves relevant. Its a far more engaging decision to know that spamming that powerful move could lead me to needing to skip a turn rather then just being unable to use it after 5 times. This change also effectively neuters PP stalling, while energy draining moves offer a more interesting replacement. 3. The Story: I know its a low bar but Coromon has a far more engaging main story then any recent pokemon game. Having a character that actually talks and emotes helps a fair bit in that regard as well. I wouldn't call it excellent, but its perfectly serviceable to carry you along a first time playthrough. 4. Difficulty: Coromon has a highly customisable set of difficulty options to cater to multiple playstyles and playthroughs. This is a welcome change to some of the frankly nonsensical options Pokemon has on offer like needing to beat White 2 in order to unlock easy mode or stripping away options for players to customise their experience in SWSH. In Coromon on normal difficulty the bosses and even some random trainers have put their foot down when I assumed they would be pushover fodder, while in SWSH the notion of a possible defeat never even came into my mind until the final boss. Coromon is also not afraid to get tough in some segments where it forbids you from using items or to win with just your team building knowledge. 5. Potential and Training: In Coromon shinies have an actual purpose, as being potent (semi shiny) or perfect (shiny) give them more points to spend when they level up their potential. I think the Potential system is far FAR better then EV's and IV's for customising and differentiating different Coromon. Coromon in general is leagues more transparent in your teams actual stats and how you can influence those stats to build your ideal team. Coromon is also much more generous with ways to both find/create more potent coromon, as well as levelling them up quickly throughout the game. My only gripe with this is that at times I felt like I was somewhat missing out when I settled for a standard mon, although standard mons are perfectly capable of taking on the games challenges.6. Traits: Coromon is also a lot more liberal with the passive abilities it puts at your disposal. While I liked the idea behind hidden abilities in Pokemon, when certain pokemon require their hidden abilities to work it can quickly turn into a slog trying to get your ideal fighter. None of that here, not only do some coromon have access to 4 abilities no strings attached, you can also reroll abilities fairly early in the game. I also like the idea of biome specific traits, it keeps the spirit of hidden abilities while being more accessible and adding flavor to the world. The Bad 1. Evasion and Accuracy: You remember how annoying it was to get sand attack spammed at you by a pidgy? Or when a trainer used double team over and over? Well there's a fair bit of that in Coromon, and its just as frustrating here as it is in Pokemon. While it makes sense that kicking up a sandstorm would make it harder to land an attack turning a 100% accuracy move into a dice roll just isn't a fun mechanic. If they were really set on keeping the effects personally I would add something like X-Com's graze effect, where you have a chance to mitigate the attack rather then completely negate it. Maybe if your opponent has lowered accuracy and you have heightened evasion you could still succeed in completely negating the attack but it requires more investment. Powerful moves having a chance to miss is a good trade off, but when my opponent can turn every move into a roulette I believe the gameplay suffers.2. Animation Length: While I mentioned earlier that the sprite work is by and large excellent, and that holds true for the move effects, some effects seem to take up more time then necessary and when your using them often this can become annoying. This is especially true for some multi hit moves like Heated Horns which have the attack animation play out multiple times for each successful strike. This is in sharp contrast to a move like Multi Bolt which fires off all its successful blasts in lightning (heh) quick fashion. This is more of a nitpick then any deal breaking issue but I don't think it would hurt to trim down some of the animations to keep battles moving along. 3. Linearity: In general the world of Coromon is explored in a mostly straight line. This is something of a slump mainline pokemon games have found themselves in as well. While there are some goodies and quests to find off the beaten path you're going to be on a tight leash as far as the major areas are concerned. Again nothing of a deal breaker but Id love to see a more open world design from this series in the future. 4. Audio Nitpicks: Having nearly every Coromon's cry being its name like Pokemon do in the show was an ambitions choice. For the most part I think they did a good job with shortening/changing/distorting the cry so it sounds more like a creature then a person, but there are a few examples (looking at you Kyraptor) where it definitely feels forced. Coromon having a defeated cry would also would be nice but that's more of a wishlist sort of thing. My other issue with the audio is that certain moves like Poison Sting are way louder then others for some reason. This could be an issue with my machine but I'm honestly not sure. 5. No Trading or Co-op: Trading is something the entire potential and traits system seems to be begging for, and to their credit TRAGsoft has expressed interest in adding it. At time of writing its still absent and is sorrily missed, I got 2 potent Purrgy's and wish I could give one to my friend who is also enjoying the game. Co-op is admittedly a big ask, but it was the highlight for me when playing SWSH. I would also feel a lot better about recommending Coromon to other friends if we had a way to play together that wasn't direct PvP. Maybe remixed Titan battles with friends?6. Bugs: This game still has a few bugs, but the devs are putting out patches to fix them so this is more of an acknowledgement then a complaint. I haven't experienced anything especially disruptive or game breaking but if the notion of bugs is a no deal for you then maybe give it a bit more time.  Final Thoughts Overall Iv really enjoyed my time with Coromon and its great to see a smaller studio make improvements on a formula that the mainstream has gotten a bit too comfortable with (a comparison to Stardew Valley comes to mind). It has a lot of replay value with its customizable difficulty and I can definitely see myself replaying it in the future. I think Coromon is setting off on the right foot and while it has some room to grow I look forward to what it has in store for the future."}, {"username": "FunkMasterChunk", "comment": "I've been loving Coromon.

These come in different flavours with cheaper natural resource packs or more expensive ones focusing on food, exploration or construction leaving you not completely at the whim of RNG and allowing you to focus on the direction of your choice.Recipes can be learnt in the form of \"Ideas\"; found randomly in packs and then stored so you can easily find how to craft something again, but these are not required to actually craft the items so experimentation is rewarded with progression.A limited number of cards allowed in play at a time first appears to be a strong hindrance but actually forces you to not stockpile resources endlessly and instead prioritise keeping ones for your current goal, this card limit can be expanded naturally through constructing certain buildings.Combat is simple and slick but has surprising depth and RTS components with the ability to kite monsters around the board.3-5 Hours of gameplay depending on your skill level but for such a low price it's an absolute gem to spend an evening on.Highly recommended and would love to see more content/similar games in the future."}, {"username": "Nutty...", "comment": "Fun little game, worth the $5.

It felt like a mixture of Darksiders, Warframe, and a few other games that scratched an itch. But that enjoyment quickly turned into an annoying disappointment. Annoying so much that I almost smashed my keyboard - and I'm someone that has finished souls games without ever getting that urge, that should tell you something perhaps. A hard pass if you are going to play solo. There are a lot of enemy attacks that knock you down, and the amount of time you spend hugging the floor is too much. That combined with the amount of enemies you face that can knock you down, you spend a lot of time hugging the floor. You can get a skill to get back up quicker, but it's a timed skill and if you miss the window you'll spend the full duration. Dodging feels extremely stiff and clunky. The game encourages you to parry with an extremely generous parry window, however everytime you parry, the screen flashes bright white as if you are flashbanging yourself. Any bright effect should have a toggle to disable the said effect.None of the \"Valorplates\" (characters) I played as felt unique as they don't have an active skill. Well, technically they do, but it's a very slow-charging active that provides you with a super buff for a certain duration, so it felt more like a passive than an active. They all have passives and a few other things that make them inclined towards certain builds, but the lack of actives made them feel like copy/pastes for me. I'm gonna cut it short here. In my opinion, this formula - mixing melee combat with a looter has great potential, but this game misses the point in my opinion. I've never felt like this for any game before to be honest, initially I was enjoying it immensely, then all of a sudden I started to hate it. I'm still playing it to see if it'll get any better though. Because that itch needs scratching."}, {"username": "Phat Earther", "comment": "18 hours into the game and I find myself deeply lost in it.

It just can't catch up to enemy and I have to wait, in the middle of battle, for it to turn around.-Game punishes player for playing agressively and rewards for playing slow and defensively. Can't cancel animations, enemies sometimes ignore you attacking them and proceed with their own attacks, parries and counterattacks deal more damage and sometimes allow to do takedown an enemy on of the skills allowes you to overcharge your shield and make it reflect 25% of damage back to attackers.-Battles against more than one enemy suck. They're just unfair. Whenever you start attacking one enemy, you immediately get attacked from behind by several others. The little arrow near character that supposed to show that you have enemies behind you is useless and almost impossible to see during battle. Enemies constantly attack through each other. Game often locks your camera like you're dueling one of them and turns you back to other enemies. Aim assist is horrible, I often thow my shield into wrong enemy despite me looking at the one I want to hit.-Some enemies' animations are too quick and abrupt. Grieves or Excelsious, for example.-Many bosses will constantly spawn adds which is bad because \"Battles against more than one enemy suck\".-Exploration sucks. No interesting encounters, just corridors and little arenas with enemies. Only interactables are: chests, resources (1 for each area) and lore notes.-Shield throw is the only way to hit interactables that are hanging in the air during explorations. The problem is - it has a CD. What is the point of a cooldown for shield throw outside of battle? If I miss the thing I need to hit I will have to just stand on one place for 30 seconds waiting for it to recharge. Why isn't it a free ability outside of battle without any CD or with very little CD (around few seconds max).-Tower of loot is boring to play solo.-Spirit realm mode is boring and very uncomfortable to play solo (have to constantly jump between realms to fight different enemies, can hold only 5 souls, etc.). It's obvious that these modes were made for coop.-Bugs. Got stuck and had to restart last 20 minutes of game. Interface bugged and started blinking, had to restart the game several times for it to disappear. Some of items in inventory can become \"locked\" and you won't be able to dispose of them in any way. What is the point of locked items anyway, just allow me to salvage them no matter if they're equipped!

But it's not a landmark must play either. There is nothing new to see here. Everything within, you've likely done before -- perhaps more times than you can count. But at the very least it offers a somewhat competent experience; but that is only because you have been spared the Early Access state of the game which first emerged on the Epic Store. Godfall is best described as that insufferable person you knew in High School that claimed to have the all the very best ideas. According to them, their dream title would be set within an awesome and amazing world; where one may experience epic clashes not just against monsters, but against the very gods themselves!! Surely once you sat down with that person and finally heard what they had to say, you were met with not only wholly unoriginal ideas -- but those that were incredibly trite and insanely shallow as well. This is the nature of Godfall; and by extension, Counterplay Games. For without a shadow a doubt, the inexperienced developers over at Counterplay found this ambitious title to be well beyond their means.But is it truly such a bad game? In the end there are numerous games of far poorer quality. Yet to measure oneself upon the failures of others, is to merely crown oneself as King of a hill of corpses. It is a painfully mediocre game; crap of the highest quality; a truly polished turd if there ever was one. Despite that, it is still somewhat playable. There is enjoyment to be had here, in the same vein that there is enjoyment to be had in eating a tub of icecream while bingeing RomComs. You'll be given a sense of mild satiation, but there are far better things you can do with your time.Godfall is a strange creature; it proclaims great things, but underdelivers in just about every front. Furthermore, it has tried to appoint itself as King of a genre by coining a new term (Looter-Slasher), and exploiting the Google Search results of that term. But there is nothing new to be found here. Godfall follows beat-for-beat gameplay and mechanics introduced in titles such as Hellgate: London (2007), Dungeon Defenders (2010), and more recently even Warframe (2013). You will encounter much of what you've experienced before; narrow hallways connecting a collecting of small areas populated by a handful of monsters. Breakable objects throughout contain currency, health, and the occasional hidden collectable just out of reach.Troubled DevelopmentThe history of Godfall has been a turbulent at best. It was the very definition of rushed to launch, where any early adopter at that time was rendered an involuntary Beta Tester. Upon the game's release there was only a handful of things to do and the only legitimate Endgame was the Ascended Tower of Trials; which at the time was an endless assortment of floors that promised randomized encounters. However, anyone who made it past floor 30 would be quick to tell you that all floor patterns repeated indefinitely until you either died or simply got bored of the effort.The game boasted a few different modes, one of them being Explore the Realm; which allowed you to tackle one of the three regions available at the time (Earth, Water, or Air) -- unhindered by story prompts and cut scenes. It was, at the time, one of the more promising of the modes as it encouraged you to make use of many underutilized features like Spirit Vision. However, the Water and Air Regions of this mode were fraught with game breaking glitches that left them entirely unplayable. Rendering the Earth Region the only example of a feature complete Explore Mode at the time.However, instead of providing prompt fixes to these issues; Explore the Realm Mode was stripped from the game entirely and replaced with a stripped down version. After an additional year of development, it was finally re-released when they introduced the fourth and final realm; Fire. Another example of troubled development was the game's Augmentation System. This allowed players to slot upgrades into Valorplates so that they may better tune their builds. One such Augment, known as Void Shell, was improperly coded. This was a High Tier Legendary Augment that a lot of players wished to use due to its regenerative and defensive properties. However, the augment remained useless until the Lightbringer Update; which came out more than a year and a half after release. But these are just some of the problems that help to paint a picture of how this game has performed. Endgame InstabilitiesAs noted before, the Ascended Tower of Trials was the only viable Endgame for a great deal of time. This was no longer the case of the Lightbringers Update, and the new six-man mode introduced alongside the game's release of Steam. Yet one of the most painful and game breaking bugs with the Ascended Tower of Trials persists to this very day, and one that traps players and renders them incapable of completing the mode at intended. The Tower consists of a variety of chambers. Accessing each chamber prompts the player with a challenge that they must complete in order to progress. However, it has been a known issue that sometimes not all of the enemies properly spawn into the playfield. This means the player is unable to complete the objective as the all enemies haven't been killed. The door would then remain locked, forever trapping the player. This would then force them to abandon the mission and lose all progress. Despite this, Players retain all loot gained, but any Boons or positive effects they've acquired along the way are stripped -- as the run is considered finished. Boons are unique buffs which are ushered in via RNG, meaning a run can be extremely easy or incredibly difficult depending on which Boons you happen by. A 'Good Run' could be completely stolen from the Player because the game failed to do what it was designed to do; which is incredibly infuriating to say the least. This has been a problem since Beta, and unfortunately may still persist well into the Steam release. But that has yet to be determined as of the writing of this review.Other Modes, such as Lightbringer; offer a unique experience with a variety of Lamps that a player can activate. These lamps provide not only a haven for the Player, but guide them toward a variety of objectives sprawled throughout the map. However, there was little care and foresight in the positioning of these lamps. If a Player is not careful they can find themselves trapped. They can descend from higher terrain into a gap between the lamp and a few rocks, rendering them unable to move. Since there is no handy recall function, this means the only way to escape is to die or to Abandon the mission entirely. Either way, this can spell the end of run via means beyond the player's control.Final ThoughtsOverall the game isn’t bad, but it’s not a masterpiece either.  There are far worse games out there. This is very much a solid value at $30 US, and I genuinely mean that. This game is far better than similar titles like Outriders. This has the benefit of several years of additional development, so it’ll be coming out the gate on Steam swinging. It’s far from the puttering fart of a game it was on Epic a few years back.

But for the most part, solid. The music is kinda generic, lots of heavy guitar and drums. More of a heavy metal rip and tear vibe than eldritch horror, which isn't bad, but it does conflict with how much effort they put into making the art so creepy and alien. Missed opportunity to lean more into horror in some sections. Voice acting is corny and mildly annoying, I played as the Journalist, and she almost exclusively spouts lame \"action hero\" one liners akin to Bombshell from Ion fury, triggered by certain in-game actions like picking up health.Story:Completely and utterly forgettable. The story is mainly delivered by what sounds like someone doing their best Darkest Dungeon narrator impression. Something about chasing a relative or acquaintance for some reason to get a special Cthulu key, for some reason, and fight a cult for some reason. It's really bare-bones. The game is also filled with \"audiolog\" style content, little clues on the ground you can interact with to get a small tidbit of information. Calling them clues would be extremely generous though, they all pretty much tell you nothing. It's almost always some useless scrap of mundane information that you don't have the context to understand or care about. I doubt even serious lore nerds will find themselves getting invested in hunting for these little nothings. I stopped checking them about 2 levels in.Gameplay:The shooting is crisp and there is good hit feedback on enemies. Popping headshots is satisfying because of the gory animations. It's fast paced and requires constant movement and quick and accurate shooting. Hitboxes can be a little finicky and hard to hit sometimes, but for the most part the shooting is solid. A lack of alternate fire is disappointing, right clicking is instead the dedicated \"hold up flashlight\" button which also puts away your gun. This is only used for the predictable gimmick sections where they shut the lights out and you have to use the flashlight briefly to navigate. This really only happened right after the flashlight was introduced, and I basically never used it again. I chose hard mode for my first playthrough and that seems decently balanced for a first run for an experienced fps player, but I have noted some major flaws as I've progressed through the game. The first being the upgrade system.     You gain xp from killing enemies, and when you level up you get pointed to spend on a branching tree of upgrades. These range from simply gaining more health or armor to completely changing one of your guns into a different version. This is where some problems arise. Upgrade are permanent, you are locked in as soon as you select them. This would be a fine - if slightly annoying - design decision, if it weren't for the fact that these \"upgrades\" aren't always upgrades. I decided to \"upgrade\" my mp34, a reliable long range machine gun, into the grenade launcher variant. Once you have this variant, ammo for this weapon becomes extremely scarce, I found only one or two packs of 5 in very long branching levels, with multiple keys and sections. The grenade launcher must be extremely powerful right to justify this scarcity? No, not really, it's pretty weak. It has a narrow hitbox for direct hits, mediocre damage, and a very small explosion effect. A direct hit on common mid-tier enemies will result in dealing 2/3 of their health, and you only have around ~5-10 shots per level. Those kinds of enemies appear by the dozens. I could kill about 100x more enemies with the original, un-\"upgraded\" version of the weapon, as it was strong and had plentiful ammo. This is not the only example of getting locked into a downgrade either. I decided to try out the \"throwing knife\" upgrade for the basic knife. Whoops, this reduces the knife from a solid but risky fallback melee option, into what basically amounts to throwing pebbles at enemies. Throwing knives travel slowly in an arc and deal about 1/20th of mid tier enemies hp bar per hit. I'm in the middle of act 2 and I've essentially already deleted 2 weapons from my arsenal by locking myself into crappy versions with the upgrade system. Thankfully, not all the upgrades are like this (the eldritch shotgun upgrades are awesome and powerful) but for an upgrade system to be fun, investing points should always result in getting stronger or having more options to play with, not nerfing yourself. It wouldn't be so bad if you could redo your points or even unlock multiple variants, but right now getting stuck with a useless weapon for an entire playthrough is just extremely disappointing.      Unfortunately, this problem of giving the player weak tools carries over to another major aspect of the gameplay, which is the active abilities you can use every so often by racking up \"insanity points\". The list of abilities sounds cool on paper, an angelic life draining sword berserk mode, a camera flash that stuns enemies close to you, a voodoo doll that nukes in an AOE around you, and a temporary slowmo effect. These abilities should result in a cool big moment of power where you use them to turn the tide in your favor temporarily, and to an extent they are that, but they are mostly too limited to be really satisfying to use. The sword power up for instance, really suffers from the finicky hitboxes in the game. For some reason they decided that the hitbox of the sword would be exactly 1 pixel in the center of the screen that can hit exactly 1 enemy at a time and only if you're close enough for them to hit you back. The sword deals a decent amount of damage, but only restores ~10 hp per hit, and most enemies on hard mode hit for at least 20-40 damage per hit. This means that instead of resulting in a fun cool moment of slicing through hordes of enemies while stealing back health, it's actually almost never a good idea to use this power. All they would have to do to fix it would be to make it cleave across the screen instead, with a decent reach and ability to hit multiple enemies. Immediately, this power would be fun and cool to use. Similarly, the camera flash sounds decent on paper, but enemies have to be basically right next to you for it to work at all, and thus stunning enemies is rarely useful because most melee enemies are fodder and die in just a hit or two from any of the non-terrible weapons in the game. It's a flash effect right, why not just let it stun everyone looking at you? The voodoo magic explosion is fine, if a little underwhelming, and the slow-mo power is just about the only one that feels strong to use. Unfortunately, even this is hampered by the fact that you can't use any power in combination with the others! Why! Being able to slow down time to position a voodoo explosion, or go on a slow-mo rampage with the sword would actually make those powers more fun, but for some reason, you are limited to 1 at a time. Final thoughts:     It might sound like I hated played this game, but honestly, it's fine, I had some fun. It's just very frustrating that with some small tweaks like buffing some useless weapons, improving the power of the abilities and letting you use them in combination, and allowing you to respec or unlock multiple weapon variants would result in a experience that is way more fun. It's difficult to recommend this game for $20 when something like Dusk exists, but maybe if they come back and make some balance tweaks with an emphasis on improving the fun factor of some core features it wouldn't be."}, {"username": "ShamblingGoatMother", "comment": "Forgive me Father because I have sinned; I purchased off a grey market site some time ago and the least I can do now is tell you that It is indeed worth it full price off steam and leave a good review.

Since there's another character with four different abilities and branching skills / upgrades, this may warrant another run for some, however all the rest will stay the same. Arena-based Endless Mode is present for those interested, as well.Is it worth buying?The base price of 20€ is fair for this amount of content and quality, considering the genre. I can safely recommend purchase at full price, as the many good points overcome the blunders by a large margin.Verdict: GoodRating Chart HereA solid entry in the Old-School Shooter subgenre. Despite some flaws, it proves fun and interesting to play for the most part. Fans of shooters will like the changes it introduces, while still staying true to the genre's roots.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720285In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingPlaying as either a Journalist or Priest, players will be called to a remote town in order to investigate a series of strange events, which culminated with the disappearance of the entire city's population. This gives an incipit for our protagonist of choice to go through increasingly maddening locales, in what soon becomes a struggle for survival. In an Old School FPS, expecting an elaborate story is out of the question; regardless, there are actually a good number of documents and indirect narration elements that give out clues, tidbits about the events that went down - inspired to the Cthulhu Mythos and other supernatural cults. Despite being an unimportant requirement for this genre, the writing itself is of good quality; the same can be said for voice acting and narration - even if the voice-lines do get rather repetitive in the midst of battle, after several hours. Overall, a solid mark in this department.Combat SystemThe prime activity in FMF will be, of course, shooting heaps of cultists, mutants, abominations and everything in-between. To do so properly, you'll progressively unlock new weapons found every couple of levels, each of them using different types of ammo and having a distinct purpose on the field - although there are some redundancies. Expect an old-school feel and pacing to the gunplay, as circle-strafing and kiting enemies around while vomiting lead are the peak strategies during combat... but not always! FMF does have several levels that encourage or even force a more considerate playstyle, as they hide enemies or other hindrances behind corners, walls and such obstacles, so you can't just rush and run as you'd think. It's a nice change of pace that forces you to reconsider your approach.Both characters have four different skills; on paper, the Priest's are more defensive while the Journo's encourage aggressiveness, and this is true to an extent. Especially later on, however, the former's skills will simply prove better, as you can't really compare powerful statuses like total invincibility or infinite ammo, with a relatively miserable AoE damage or slow motion that, while useful, just don't feel as good as the holy man's feats. Such skills can be used via Madness, a mana-like stat charged by either taking or dealing damage, granting permanent charges for each ability as it increases. All feats can be upgraded to enhance their effectiveness or duration significantly, but never their core functioning. Weapons may as well be upgraded with the skill points gained by slaying enemies, with mutually-excluding patterns that transform them into significantly better - or different - murder tools. In the end there's a choice to be made between favoring better weapons or better skills, as there're not enough skill points for everything in the long run.Enemies prove varied and interesting, with each act sporting many unique variations. Some of them have weak-spots that, when hit, cause them to mutate (generally becoming weaker) and change their behavior. This rewards accuracy and know-how, but isn't really a core mechanic, as it can be done only on a handful of foes compared to the total. All enemies, on higher settings, hit like trucks while healing and ammo are sparingly found; an issue that becomes overwhelming in the last act and makes it a frustrating, unbalanced mess of bullet sponges and ill-conceived layouts.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792999356General GameplayAside from the general slaughter, you'll want to take your time in finding secrets and lore files, present in almost every level. The bounties of supplies present in hidden areas can really make the difference between a resource-starved fighter and a ready-for-anything one. With how little ammo and health there is around, especially later on, you'll soon want to become a treasure hunter, no doubt. FMF uses fixed save points in the shape of a drunken hobo, appearing once in a while to retain your progress unlimited times, but only at fixed locations. You'll also want to find color-coded keys to open doors, as it's customary in the genre.Boss FightsEach act has one boss, and all of them, except maybe one (Act 4) prove decently designed, challenging and feel unique. These powerful foes feature evolving attack patterns as they lose HP, and often spawn additional minions you gotta deal with, or soon get overwhelmed by the crossfire. It feels like latter ones are a bit too much on the bullet-spongy side, but nothing too bad in this regard. Even if multi-phased, arena-swapping in some cases, all bosses must be restarted from the start without checkpoints in case of death, which is fine.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720181Other Game ModesAfter the main story, for those who really can't get enough, endless mode is present with five unique arenas where you have to survive as long as you can with either the Journalist or Priest, against increasingly powerful foes, on a difficulty setting of your choice - while upgrading yourself and your arsenal. Completionists and achievement hunters will get into this surely, but in the end it's just \"more of the same\" without significant variations."}, {"username": "cHaoS", "comment": "I really want to like this game. And it was great fun in the first few chapters. But then it began to become worse and worse. While the gunplay is decent, the weapons are fun and the enemy visual design is great, more and more flaws started to accumulate. It ended with me running out of ammo in chapter 5, so I could not continue to play. The enemies become more and more bullet sponges. And while it wasn't a big problem in the first levels, it became more and more annoying how little sound the enemies make. They often spawn behind you or out of sight and you only realize that they're there, when you are hit with a volley of projectiles, losing half your health. As I said, the visual presentation is really great. But the atmosphere does not fit a Cthulhu Mythos game. Unfortunately I can't recommend this."}, {"username": "Enigmatic Salp", "comment": "Pros:-Fantastic gameplayThis game just feels good.  You can headshot most enemies, which is highly effective, though there are enemies who have clever work-arounds with it; such as a zombie that carries an extra head it puts on after you shoot off the first, or an armored enemy with exposed fuel tanks you can shoot to partially melt him.  There are also a lot of enemy varieties, which helps keep gameplay feeling fresh.  Even a guy who throws exploding fish!-Good level designLots of secrets, great looking environments, and many unique encounters make each moment enjoyable, and re-enjoyable.  A great example is an early map in the second episode, in a graveyard.  There are mostly low-tier zombie enemies, but lots of tall grass.  You can hear them, so you know they are present, but finding them before they get close takes effort, and you have to watch your back.-Solid weapons (all of which are useful)I find myself using every single weapon I've gotten so far.  Even the melee!  The starting pistol is weak but accurate and great for headshotting low-tier enemies to save ammo.  The only downside I'd have to say is some sound a bit weak, but not every gun can be the Super Shotgun from Doom 2.-A lot of levelsTwenty-five maps?  Feels like an old 90s shooter!  Loving the amount of levels.-Amazing Boss FightsI've faced two so far, and they break the stereotype of FPS games having lame or weak bosses.  These are masterclasses in good game design, IMO.-Great priceGame is a third the price of a AAA title and feels far more polished than one.Cons:-Some guns sound weakJust as it says.  I wish they had a bit more heft to their sound, though it's not a dealbreaker.-The Voice acting is badPerhaps they were going for old-school over the top, but it leaves a bit to be desired.  Fortunately, you can skip most of it save for the one-liners during gameplay which are tolerable.Neutral:-There's an upgrade system.Feels a bit out of place in an old-school FPS, but it's reasonably implemented, I suppose.  Even with the \"get more XP\" talents, leveling seems very slow.  I wouldn't say you even get one per level.-The story is just . . . there.Lots of \"story\" prompts around maps and beforehand exist.  I like Lovecraftian horror, but I've not been too interested in them.  It exists, is all I can really say about it.-There are two classes with recharging abilities.Another thing that seems more modern, there are two classes, one more based on offense and the other more defensive.  They have abilities that recharge as you kill enemies.  These powers are generally good and borderline essential on higher difficulties - I'd say they're well done."}, {"username": "Kal", "comment": "A dude threw a fish at me and I died.Joking aside, Forgive Me Father is a pretty good \"boomer shooter\". It just got released and needs a bit more polish to be great (notably in its tells ; the enemies make very little sound so it's hard to tell when one sneaks up on you, and there is no indicator when you take damage of the direction it came from), but it's still very enjoyable.One thing, though. The store page advertises its \"lovecraftian ambiance\". That is NOT true. A lovecraftian ambiance would mean making slow, deliberate progress while being in constant danger from incomprehensible horrors that will kill you, while being surrounded by strange secrets. In this game, you zip around at mach 3 and shoot the horrors in the face with a shotgun, turning them into fine red mist, and read a few scattered notes here and there while your character makes quip. You certainly are in a lovecraftian world, but the ambiance isn't there. This is NOT a horror game. Not at all."}, {"username": "crimsonforest", "comment": "Minimalistic, good dark music, reminiscent of Subterrain game. The menu immediately reminded me of the Darkest Dungeon production. The game quickly introduces the fight. Opponents have relatively large hitboxes which makes it easy to aim at enemies and quickly turn them into red slush. It surprised me, it seems easy with single enemies, but the level of difficulty changes dramatically when you have to deal with hordes of enemies. Here, more powerful weapons come in handy and you can choose from a large arsenal. I like the approach to the character development tree. You can choose one of two ways for each of the weapons, which encourages to repeat the production and try all available builds. The game is well optimized. It is easy to play on 12-year-old hardware.

The upgrade system, and the lore/aesthetic are enough to set Forgive Me Father apart from the sea of retro/boomer shooters and make for an easy recommendation. 8/10 based on mechanic and visual design, 15/10 for shotgun cause based."}, {"username": "Chuck Ironstag", "comment": "Amongst the best Shotgun feel in FPS history, true successor to Blood's IMO"}, {"username": "Tamaster", "comment": "Sum-UpIn-depth analysis further down.🟩 Pros🟥 Cons- Unique visual style, that shows excellent art direction consistently.- Solid gunplay: each weapon feels diverse and fun to use.- A true but (mostly) fair challenge, even for FPS veterans, on the higher difficulty settings.- Good variety of enemies, gameplay variations and weapons to use / upgrade.- Overall solid boss design, despite some blunders.- Poor characters balance: Priest's skill-set is clearly superior to the Journalist's.- Terrible ammo economy in the latter two chapters.- The last chapter (Act 5) feels rushed, uninteresting and annoyingly-designed.- XP / leveling progression grinds to a halt further down the line.🟨 Bugs & Issues🔧 Specs- Rarely, some enemies may become invisible unintentionally.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:Took me about 11 hours to complete FMF on Hard difficulty (I admit switching to Normal in the last chapter, due to the awful ammo economy); this taking time to spot secrets and read lore files when possible. Since there's another character with four different abilities and branching skills / upgrades, this may warrant another run for some, however all the rest will stay the same. Arena-based Endless Mode is present for those interested, as well.Is it worth buying?The base price of 20€ is fair for this amount of content and quality, considering the genre. I can safely recommend purchase at full price, as the many good points overcome the blunders by a large margin.Verdict: GoodRating Chart HereA solid entry in the Old-School Shooter subgenre. Despite some flaws, it proves fun and interesting to play for the most part. Fans of shooters will like the changes it introduces, while still staying true to the genre's roots.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720285In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingPlaying as either a Journalist or Priest, players will be called to a remote town in order to investigate a series of strange events, which culminated with the disappearance of the entire city's population. This gives an incipit for our protagonist of choice to go through increasingly maddening locales, in what soon becomes a struggle for survival. In an Old School FPS, expecting an elaborate story is out of the question; regardless, there are actually a good number of documents and indirect narration elements that give out clues, tidbits about the events that went down - inspired to the Cthulhu Mythos and other supernatural cults. Despite being an unimportant requirement for this genre, the writing itself is of good quality; the same can be said for voice acting and narration - even if the voice-lines do get rather repetitive in the midst of battle, after several hours. Overall, a solid mark in this department.Combat SystemThe prime activity in FMF will be, of course, shooting heaps of cultists, mutants, abominations and everything in-between. To do so properly, you'll progressively unlock new weapons found every couple of levels, each of them using different types of ammo and having a distinct purpose on the field - although there are some redundancies. Expect an old-school feel and pacing to the gunplay, as circle-strafing and kiting enemies around while vomiting lead are the peak strategies during combat... but not always! FMF does have several levels that encourage or even force a more considerate playstyle, as they hide enemies or other hindrances behind corners, walls and such obstacles, so you can't just rush and run as you'd think. It's a nice change of pace that forces you to reconsider your approach.Both characters have four different skills; on paper, the Priest's are more defensive while the Journo's encourage aggressiveness, and this is true to an extent. Especially later on, however, the former's skills will simply prove better, as you can't really compare powerful statuses like total invincibility or infinite ammo, with a relatively miserable AoE damage or slow motion that, while useful, just don't feel as good as the holy man's feats. Such skills can be used via Madness, a mana-like stat charged by either taking or dealing damage, granting permanent charges for each ability as it increases. All feats can be upgraded to enhance their effectiveness or duration significantly, but never their core functioning. Weapons may as well be upgraded with the skill points gained by slaying enemies, with mutually-excluding patterns that transform them into significantly better - or different - murder tools. In the end there's a choice to be made between favoring better weapons or better skills, as there're not enough skill points for everything in the long run.Enemies prove varied and interesting, with each act sporting many unique variations. Some of them have weak-spots that, when hit, cause them to mutate (generally becoming weaker) and change their behavior. This rewards accuracy and know-how, but isn't really a core mechanic, as it can be done only on a handful of foes compared to the total. All enemies, on higher settings, hit like trucks while healing and ammo are sparingly found; an issue that becomes overwhelming in the last act and makes it a frustrating, unbalanced mess of bullet sponges and ill-conceived layouts.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792999356General GameplayAside from the general slaughter, you'll want to take your time in finding secrets and lore files, present in almost every level. The bounties of supplies present in hidden areas can really make the difference between a resource-starved fighter and a ready-for-anything one. With how little ammo and health there is around, especially later on, you'll soon want to become a treasure hunter, no doubt. FMF uses fixed save points in the shape of a drunken hobo, appearing once in a while to retain your progress unlimited times, but only at fixed locations. You'll also want to find color-coded keys to open doors, as it's customary in the genre.Boss FightsEach act has one boss, and all of them, except maybe one (Act 4) prove decently designed, challenging and feel unique. These powerful foes feature evolving attack patterns as they lose HP, and often spawn additional minions you gotta deal with, or soon get overwhelmed by the crossfire. It feels like latter ones are a bit too much on the bullet-spongy side, but nothing too bad in this regard. Even if multi-phased, arena-swapping in some cases, all bosses must be restarted from the start without checkpoints in case of death, which is fine.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791720181Other Game ModesAfter the main story, for those who really can't get enough, endless mode is present with five unique arenas where you have to survive as long as you can with either the Journalist or Priest, against increasingly powerful foes, on a difficulty setting of your choice - while upgrading yourself and your arsenal. Completionists and achievement hunters will get into this surely, but in the end it's just \"more of the same\" without significant variations."}, {"username": "cHaoS", "comment": "I really want to like this game. And it was great fun in the first few chapters. But then it began to become worse and worse. While the gunplay is decent, the weapons are fun and the enemy visual design is great, more and more flaws started to accumulate. It ended with me running out of ammo in chapter 5, so I could not continue to play. The enemies become more and more bullet sponges. And while it wasn't a big problem in the first levels, it became more and more annoying how little sound the enemies make. They often spawn behind you or out of sight and you only realize that they're there, when you are hit with a volley of projectiles, losing half your health. As I said, the visual presentation is really great. But the atmosphere does not fit a Cthulhu Mythos game. Unfortunately I can't recommend this."}, {"username": "Enigmatic Salp", "comment": "Pros:-Fantastic gameplayThis game just feels good.  You can headshot most enemies, which is highly effective, though there are enemies who have clever work-arounds with it; such as a zombie that carries an extra head it puts on after you shoot off the first, or an armored enemy with exposed fuel tanks you can shoot to partially melt him.  There are also a lot of enemy varieties, which helps keep gameplay feeling fresh.  Even a guy who throws exploding fish!-Good level designLots of secrets, great looking environments, and many unique encounters make each moment enjoyable, and re-enjoyable.  A great example is an early map in the second episode, in a graveyard.  There are mostly low-tier zombie enemies, but lots of tall grass.  You can hear them, so you know they are present, but finding them before they get close takes effort, and you have to watch your back.-Solid weapons (all of which are useful)I find myself using every single weapon I've gotten so far.  Even the melee!  The starting pistol is weak but accurate and great for headshotting low-tier enemies to save ammo.  The only downside I'd have to say is some sound a bit weak, but not every gun can be the Super Shotgun from Doom 2.-A lot of levelsTwenty-five maps?  Feels like an old 90s shooter!  Loving the amount of levels.-Amazing Boss FightsI've faced two so far, and they break the stereotype of FPS games having lame or weak bosses.  These are masterclasses in good game design, IMO.-Great priceGame is a third the price of a AAA title and feels far more polished than one.Cons:-Some guns sound weakJust as it says.  I wish they had a bit more heft to their sound, though it's not a dealbreaker.-The Voice acting is badPerhaps they were going for old-school over the top, but it leaves a bit to be desired.  Fortunately, you can skip most of it save for the one-liners during gameplay which are tolerable.Neutral:-There's an upgrade system.Feels a bit out of place in an old-school FPS, but it's reasonably implemented, I suppose.  Even with the \"get more XP\" talents, leveling seems very slow.  I wouldn't say you even get one per level.-The story is just . . . there.Lots of \"story\" prompts around maps and beforehand exist.  I like Lovecraftian horror, but I've not been too interested in them.  It exists, is all I can really say about it.-There are two classes with recharging abilities.Another thing that seems more modern, there are two classes, one more based on offense and the other more defensive.  They have abilities that recharge as you kill enemies.  These powers are generally good and borderline essential on higher difficulties - I'd say they're well done."}, {"username": "Kal", "comment": "A dude threw a fish at me and I died.Joking aside, Forgive Me Father is a pretty good \"boomer shooter\". It just got released and needs a bit more polish to be great (notably in its tells ; the enemies make very little sound so it's hard to tell when one sneaks up on you, and there is no indicator when you take damage of the direction it came from), but it's still very enjoyable.One thing, though. The store page advertises its \"lovecraftian ambiance\". That is NOT true. A lovecraftian ambiance would mean making slow, deliberate progress while being in constant danger from incomprehensible horrors that will kill you, while being surrounded by strange secrets. In this game, you zip around at mach 3 and shoot the horrors in the face with a shotgun, turning them into fine red mist, and read a few scattered notes here and there while your character makes quip. You certainly are in a lovecraftian world, but the ambiance isn't there. This is NOT a horror game. Not at all."}, {"username": "crimsonforest", "comment": "Minimalistic, good dark music, reminiscent of Subterrain game. The menu immediately reminded me of the Darkest Dungeon production. The game quickly introduces the fight. Opponents have relatively large hitboxes which makes it easy to aim at enemies and quickly turn them into red slush. It surprised me, it seems easy with single enemies, but the level of difficulty changes dramatically when you have to deal with hordes of enemies. Here, more powerful weapons come in handy and you can choose from a large arsenal. I like the approach to the character development tree. You can choose one of two ways for each of the weapons, which encourages to repeat the production and try all available builds. The game is well optimized. It is easy to play on 12-year-old hardware. Also, an average laptop is enough to play the game.

I pre-ordered The Skywalker Saga a few days before its release; and at 100 hours of the game played, all 9 episodes completed, and 900 Kyber Bricks collected, I feel I can give an informed review. I will be judging the game on individual metrics, and then I'll give my final score.Exploration - 10/10If I could only mention one aspect of this game at exceeded my expectations, it would certainly be the vast galaxy laden with puzzles, side missions, and collectibles. I would hazard a guess that the average player will spend upwards of 200 hours achieving 100% completion of this game. The developers give the player the freedom to explore hub worlds immediately after discovering the planet; this allowed me to take frequent breaks from the episodic story to pursue all of the hidden collectibles throughout the worlds. In my opinion, the most fun part of this game is exploring the hub worlds. It is a completionist's paradise.Progression - 7/10I really appreciate when developers put time into erecting a progression system in their game - especially in an open-world genre; this allows players to work towards an eventual goal as they complete missions. In the early game, I looked forward to acquiring faster sprint speeds and stud magnet ranges. Later, I looked closer at the class-specific abilities and started investing in the Bounty Hunter and Dark Jedi. I wasn't expecting much in the way of a progression system from this game and was pleasantly surprised when I learned one was implemented. That said, I can't score the game too highly as I feel that most of the abilities are not particularly impressive. Once I had collected 500 Kyber Bricks, I was able to unlock all of the useful abilities, after which my interest in collecting more Kyber Bricks diminished. I still fully intend on obtaining all 1166, but the short-term rewards are lackluster at this point.Story - 3/10I must say the story missions in this game were a chore to play. I started off with the Phantom Menace and quickly learned that the enjoyable part of the game was exploring the hub worlds, not advancing through the tediously scripted missions. I felt like for almost the entire story mode, I was traveling between checkpoints as main characters spouted the dialogue from the movies, switching classes to interact with the same darn button puzzles, or engaging in \"intense\" light-saber combat with the bosses. I was told the combat system in this game was to be more advanced, and while it technically is more complex than the original Lego Star Wars games, the developers gave up on the puzzles integrated with the boss fights. It is simply a slashing fest for five minutes for every boss: Maul, Dooku, Grievous, Anakin, Vader, Sidious, Kylo, etc. In most boss fights, once the boss reaches a certain threshold, they will run away; and it usually takes several minutes to catch up with them. This really breaks the urgency of combat. And this often occurs 2-3 times per boss. The space combat is much more enjoyable as there are no breaks in combat. You simply search and destroy the given targets until the mission is over. Luckily, there are other aspects of this game that make up for the missions' shortcomings.Movies - 9/10So glad to see that the wit of Lego games as persisted all of these years. There were many occasions I audibly laughed at the humor throughout the movies in this game. My only complaint is that you cannot access the movies anywhere in the menus. In previous installments, you could purchase and watch the movies in the shop at your leisure. It made it difficult to share funny moments with my friends/family, as I would have to find a clip on YouTube of the scene I was on just to show it.Performance - 8/10As this game has just released, I am going to cut it some slack on occasional bugs I encountered throughout playing it. I experienced only one crash in the entire game - when I attempted to equip the Shore Trooper character in my first hour of game play. The only serious bug I repeatedly encountered is the Trade Federation Battleship occupying the center of space battles when it wasn't supposed to be there. It had no substance, so it was still possible to complete the missions. Graphically, the game is beautiful. I never experienced frame drops at 3840/2160p 60hertz. (RTX 3060ti) My one complaint with the graphical settings is the FOV status. I felt way too close to my character throughout this game. I would have appreciated an in-game setting to adjust this.Overall Rating - 37/50 or 74%I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the hub worlds in this game, solving all of the puzzles, collecting all of the Kyber Bricks and Data Cards, unlocking all of the characters. To supplement the boredom of the story missions, I listened to Ben Shapiro podcasts while I played with the sound off. I wouldn't say this lives up to the glories of The Complete Saga, but did anyone actually thought it could be that good? No, I don't think so. But this game still is a lot of fun a deserves the attention that any Lego Game gets.Final RecommendationsStart with Episode 7 and unlock the scavenger items as Rey. You get them early on, and multiple puzzles require them to be completed. You don't have to finish episode 7. Just get the gear and jump back to one of the good trilogies. Don't try to 100% every hub world immediately, some Kyber Bricks and Characters can only be obtained after completing a side mission that is started on another planet. Once you've obtained all of the Kyber Bricks visible on the map, you've done all you can do for the time. Also, make sure to check inside interiors on the map.

The levels were long, the combat was too easy and really the only thing that the original game had going for it was the sheer amount of unlockables.This game fixes almost everything that's been wrong with the lego games, the combat is fun with a new combo system and lightsaber throwing, movement feels good, there's a free third person camera, the graphics are beautiful, and it doesn't ask for hours and hours of your time per session. The way they tell the story in this game is just like the older game, it's quick and only touches on what it really needs to. There are so many collectibles in this game and I've been having a good time going around collecting them all, most require you to switch to a specific character type, or solve cute well designed puzzles :)There are a few criticisms I have concerning the flow of the gameplay loop mainly in the prequel episodes, it feels like episode one and two specifically never leave you alone to explore. It was overwhelming, it asks you to travel to a new area what feels like every five minutes leaving you no room to breathe. While I like the fast progression of story in this game, for some reason it just goes WAY too fast in the prequels.The one other thing that's a little lame is that there are 'puzzles' where you walk up to a device with a specific character and perform a series of actions to open a door or power something. These are never built upon, it's always the same throughout the entire game and they feel arbitrarily placed around the game with no rhyme or reason. But honestly that's where the bad stuff ends.Finally, do not play this game in fullscreen. Play in borderless windowed. This game does not want you to tab out and trying to tab back in after doing so will either result in the game being scaled down to 800x600 and you having to set it back or the game just not focusing again. you have been warned.Overall this game has been a blast so far and i'm excited to keep going.

The levels were long, the combat was too easy and really the only thing that the original game had going for it was the sheer amount of unlockables.This game fixes almost everything that's been wrong with the lego games, the combat is fun with a new combo system and lightsaber throwing, movement feels good, there's a free third person camera, the graphics are beautiful, and it doesn't ask for hours and hours of your time per session. The way they tell the story in this game is just like the older game, it's quick and only touches on what it really needs to. There are so many collectibles in this game and I've been having a good time going around collecting them all, most require you to switch to a specific character type, or solve cute well designed puzzles :)There are a few criticisms I have concerning the flow of the gameplay loop mainly in the prequel episodes, it feels like episode one and two specifically never leave you alone to explore. It was overwhelming, it asks you to travel to a new area what feels like every five minutes leaving you no room to breathe. While I like the fast progression of story in this game, for some reason it just goes WAY too fast in the prequels.The one other thing that's a little lame is that there are 'puzzles' where you walk up to a device with a specific character and perform a series of actions to open a door or power something. These are never built upon, it's always the same throughout the entire game and they feel arbitrarily placed around the game with no rhyme or reason. But honestly that's where the bad stuff ends.Finally, do not play this game in fullscreen. Play in borderless windowed. This game does not want you to tab out and trying to tab back in after doing so will either result in the game being scaled down to 800x600 and you having to set it back or the game just not focusing again. you have been warned.Overall this game has been a blast so far and i'm excited to keep going. It brings back the same emotions I felt when playing the original as a kid and sometimes i find myself smiling at just how immersed i am in a silly lego game :) There are a few poor trends this game follows but they don't outweigh the pros at all. play this one"}], "game_id": "920210", "game_title": "LEGO_Star_Wars_The_Skywalker_Saga"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "SANDhater", "comment": "Honse do the drift"}, {"username": "Thalq", "comment": "You can push your mate off the platform at the end with a grenade and then take the rose, only to put it on their grave.You can drift with a horse.You can throw explosive \"banana peels\" at your opponents.You can sequence break (skip) the second compound if you are good enough and have bandages.You can fire a full auto handgun that behaves like a gatling.You can doot while headbanging.You can aggressively poke at your poor defenseless map while angrily looking at your dumbfounded mate.You can blind your mate when riding by pulling out your flag and waving it around while screaming.You can also spawn a horse singularity and nuke your CPU if you're unlucky... until they fix it that is.And most importantly you can go absurdly fast if you're good at drifting, but this only happens if you play while listening to Initial D stuff or F-Zero GX OST.

In short, it is a creature collector JRPG with 1v1 (mostly, there are rare, but sometimes occurring 1v2 and 1v3, also I'm not taking into account PvP) turn-based battles. Coromon is, obviously, inspired by Pokemon, but if I had to say, it is inspired most of all by more older versions of Pokemon, like Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald.There are more than 100 (114 according to Corodex, however, due to specifics of some Coromon that I'll refrain from spoiling, I'd just say that there are over 100 of them) Coromon. Some have 3 stages of evolution, some just 2, nothing genre-breaking or game-redefining. There's no breeding, or different branches of evolution, so Coromon're all about just catching. There are 3 variations of each. Standard, Potent and Perfect. If you'd thought of Shinies, you are correct, as well as not.Standard Coromon appear 97.09% of the time (3101 to 3194), Potent 2.88% (92 to 3194) and Perfect 0.03% (1 to 3194). There's a Potency scale, which defines which one of the three they are. 1 to 16 Potency are Standard, 17 to 20 are Potent, and 21, which is a maximum of Potency, are Perfect. Potency defines how much XP you need before you'll receive 3 free stat points for a Coromon. The more Potency, the less XP is needed to acquire them. Basically, it's like additional level ups that go hand-in-hand with your usual XP progression. That means that unlike purely-cosmetic Shinies, Perfects can be stronger than their Standard counterparts. You may think of those free points as EV (Effort Values), even though that is not entirely true. For PvE it doesn't mean much, however if you're into that, stat changes will be noticeable and will make your creatures stronger, especially later on.There is a major flaw of this game, and it is it's oldschoolity in some of the design. I'm talking about unskippable/slow animations, strange inventory/menu management, long, unneeded transitions. I've spent 24 hours of the game for 3 first sections of it and then I've given up. I didn't want to speed up the game, but I just couldn't bear it. I've beat last 3 sections of the game in 6 hours. x4 times faster than first half of the game. And I didn't skip content, I've still collected all the Coromon, looted everything, seen the map, etc.I liked the animations, they are really awesome, as well as Coromon's visuals. However, I really don't want to spend this much time watching the same animations happen a thousand time. You cannot speed them up via game settings, skip is out of question as well. I honestly recommend getting used to the game at it's usual speed, watching those sweet attack animations and such, and when you are used to the gameplay loop and are able to respond to enemies' attacks accordingly, just speed it up. If I would've completed the same game in, let's say, 15 hours, instead of 30, I would've been really happy with it. Now, I really do grieve over so much time spent on weird management and needlessly prolonged battles. Though I still did enjoy the game.Thank you for reading, I hope you'll enjoy Coromon with or without the need to use a cheat engine or such."}, {"username": "Kaiserin", "comment": "why tf is flappy bird needed to progress in the storyline"}, {"username": "Arck", "comment": "Pros: Old school mon clone. Cons: Flappy Bird"}, {"username": "Arktor314", "comment": "You might think \"isn't this just a Pokemon clone?\" And you'd be mostly right. Coromon is basically the equivalent of early Pokemon made with more modern game design. It's clearly a passion project, and it's a lot of fun.Pros:* Bad puns* Efficient mon storage (easily sort by type)* Fairly simple typing system, no need to re-learn most things (Water beats Fire and Ground, for example. Ice beats Water, but that kind of makes sense.)* Good amount of RNG (critical hits, evasion, attacks that hit 1-3 times... sometimes it's nice to have to react when your plan doesn't quite work out.)* Customized bonus stat allocation. The equivalent of Pokemon's EVs, but you don't need to carefully track which enemies you're fighting. You want a max defense crab? Just put those points in defense. Want a glass cannon? Easy as pie.* Quests with a quest log.* Locations on map show which monsters are in the area, and which you have yet to catch.* Potency system. Potency (think IVs) gives you a 1:30 chance of encountering a semi-shiny mon, with a unique color and very good stats. In addition you have a 1:3000 chance of encountering a shiny mon with perfect stats. The semi-shinies are great for me as someone who loves collecting and finding rare things, but doesn't have the patience to hunt for perfect mons.* Customizable difficulty settings. You can have your mons auto-heal after each battle, make shop items cheaper; you can remove the option to escape battles, or have your mons disappear if they faint; and many more. Choose the options you want.Cons:* Some annoying minigames. (My suggestion to the developers: add an auto-bypass if you fail at them a few times. No one's buying this to play Flappy Bird.)* Puns have gone down in quantity since the first few hours of the game. I'm very sad about this.* No dual types* Battle UI doesn't show if you've caught a mon yet. It'd be very nice to easily see a spinner icon next to the monster name, for example.* Little information available on the Wiki, as of the time of writing this review.* Lots of RNG. Sometimes your best plan will fail a 90% chance three times in a row. (if you hate RNG, take a look at Temtem)"}, {"username": "Mu Shu Fasa", "comment": "This game is almost fun, it copies pokemon a bit too closely though. By that I mean coromon also copies the bad things about old pokemon games (many of which have been changed in more recent generations or more recent creature collector titles). For example:1. Way too many RNG mechanics for it ever to be interesting competitively (hax/ crits/ broken weather effects/ etc). Even in single player, RNG mechanics are neither satisfying to win with, nor do they feel fair to lose to.2. Poor balance: some types are just objectively worse (more weaknesses, fewer resists, resisted by more types/ fewer types they can hit with stab). E.g. fire gets doubly screwed over bc not only is it net 0 on the resist chart, it has no weather effect, and for some reason rain is the only weather effect in the game that lowers another types dmg (that type being fire). Sand on the other hand has great weather effect, only 1 weakness and 3 resists lul. 3. Too much grind: -I have given up on trying to find perfects/ potents of the mons I want, and likewise have given up on pvp bc it just seems like the barrier of entry is wayyyy to high to make an optimized team. -The berry planting mechanic is incredibly tedious, I don't want to have to write down where I planted what and run around to 50 different locations to gather them back up and replant. Not a fun gameplay loop. -The gem digging mini game to farm gold is equally unfun4. I don't understand the decision to make all mons monotype, it's feels so watered down from typical creature collector team building bc of this. Monotypes only also worsens the issue of imbalanced typings mentioned above.5. Lack of QOL features:-TM's are not reusable which means I end up never using them at all bc I'm afraid to waste them-No way to re-order your skills-As many others have mentioned, there are too many mandatory puzzles and mini games (for my personal preference). Many of which seem to adhere to the design philosophy seen throughout other aspects of the game: tedium over difficulty/ depth.Overall it's not a bad game its just frustrating bc it could be a hell of a lot better, I'd rate it about a 6/10 in its present state. I didn't list the positives the game has going for it bc there are plenty of positive reviews doing just that.

I would say 60%+ of the game is just doing puzzles and minigames. Not sure I'm going to bother completing it with how little and tedious the battling is compared to the amount of puzzles and minigames.None of them are particularly hard, its just really tedious.==Original Review==TLDR: Quality game, haven’t encountered any bugs and is stable so far. Has tons of feature for min-maxers for tweak their coromon. This game definitely seems aimed at those sorts rather than a chill pokemon-like game, very tedious so far.Why it’s tedious: Entirely linear, no exploration or multiple areas to train in. No secrets to be found, or side routes to be explored. Would be less of an issue if it wasn’t so grindy.Lots of puzzles – Battling often does feel like it takes a back seat to many puzzles.Excessive number of wild encounters, even when using repellent~Useful when grinding, a pain when just trying to travel. Excessive mandatory trainers blocking your paths~The equivalents of Gyms are huge and have a Gyms worth of trainers on each floor. Only thing making it bearable is I enabled regen on level up and half price shops. Otherwise I would regularly be out of items and have to backtrack to healing centers.Excessive Grinding: Even a 2-3 level difference will lead to bosses stomping your coromon, even when of an opposing type. And the excessive encounters above are still insufficient to have you at proper level by the time you reach a boss. So you’re stuck leveling in the single zones per level range."}, {"username": "JennDjinn", "comment": "Video review: https://youtu.be/4qrQbw2ENZQCoromon scratches the itch of classic Pokemon games!And while it stays true to the core gameplay,it also adds some nice features.* Great world & monster design* Challenging boss fights* About 120 Coromon* Catchy soundtrack* Loads of customization* Numerous Quality of Life features* Many different mini-games(some of which are frustrating)Turn-based combat similar to Pokemonbut with some interesting variations:* 2nd XP bar: add points to individual stats* There are standard, potent and perfect Coromon* Potent and perfect Coromon are always superior* Coromon never forget a move they learned* Each move costs SP, so there’s no PP limit"}, {"username": "IronHeaver", "comment": "I'm really glad to see more people taking a crack at the monster catching games and Coromon is a welcome breath of fresh air in a genre joined at the hip with Pokemon. As much as Id like to judge it solely on its own merits the comparison is hard to ignore but that's to be expected when competing with the largest franchise on Earth.  The Good 1. Creature Design: Coromon seems really dedicated to creating monsters that largely feel like they fit into a living breathing world, something that Pokemon seems to have less and less interest in. While I don't mind things like objectmons (Voltorb, Vanillish), I really can't stand ones that look like a Halloween costume or just set characters rather then a species of creature (Inteleon, Incineroar). Coromon's design focus leans into things that resemble functional animals for the most part with some deviations into the supernatural or technological, and its a solid design decision I hope they stick too. I should also mention that the sprite work in general is excellent. 2.Stamina as a Resource: Coromon's battle system sets it apart from pokemon while opening the door to new strategic options and potentially keeping weaker moves relevant. Its a far more engaging decision to know that spamming that powerful move could lead me to needing to skip a turn rather then just being unable to use it after 5 times. This change also effectively neuters PP stalling, while energy draining moves offer a more interesting replacement. 3. The Story: I know its a low bar but Coromon has a far more engaging main story then any recent pokemon game. Having a character that actually talks and emotes helps a fair bit in that regard as well. I wouldn't call it excellent, but its perfectly serviceable to carry you along a first time playthrough. 4. Difficulty: Coromon has a highly customisable set of difficulty options to cater to multiple playstyles and playthroughs. This is a welcome change to some of the frankly nonsensical options Pokemon has on offer like needing to beat White 2 in order to unlock easy mode or stripping away options for players to customise their experience in SWSH. In Coromon on normal difficulty the bosses and even some random trainers have put their foot down when I assumed they would be pushover fodder, while in SWSH the notion of a possible defeat never even came into my mind until the final boss. Coromon is also not afraid to get tough in some segments where it forbids you from using items or to win with just your team building knowledge. 5. Potential and Training: In Coromon shinies have an actual purpose, as being potent (semi shiny) or perfect (shiny) give them more points to spend when they level up their potential. I think the Potential system is far FAR better then EV's and IV's for customising and differentiating different Coromon. Coromon in general is leagues more transparent in your teams actual stats and how you can influence those stats to build your ideal team. Coromon is also much more generous with ways to both find/create more potent coromon, as well as levelling them up quickly throughout the game. My only gripe with this is that at times I felt like I was somewhat missing out when I settled for a standard mon, although standard mons are perfectly capable of taking on the games challenges.6. Traits: Coromon is also a lot more liberal with the passive abilities it puts at your disposal. While I liked the idea behind hidden abilities in Pokemon, when certain pokemon require their hidden abilities to work it can quickly turn into a slog trying to get your ideal fighter. None of that here, not only do some coromon have access to 4 abilities no strings attached, you can also reroll abilities fairly early in the game. I also like the idea of biome specific traits, it keeps the spirit of hidden abilities while being more accessible and adding flavor to the world. The Bad 1. Evasion and Accuracy: You remember how annoying it was to get sand attack spammed at you by a pidgy? Or when a trainer used double team over and over? Well there's a fair bit of that in Coromon, and its just as frustrating here as it is in Pokemon. While it makes sense that kicking up a sandstorm would make it harder to land an attack turning a 100% accuracy move into a dice roll just isn't a fun mechanic. If they were really set on keeping the effects personally I would add something like X-Com's graze effect, where you have a chance to mitigate the attack rather then completely negate it. Maybe if your opponent has lowered accuracy and you have heightened evasion you could still succeed in completely negating the attack but it requires more investment. Powerful moves having a chance to miss is a good trade off, but when my opponent can turn every move into a roulette I believe the gameplay suffers.2. Animation Length: While I mentioned earlier that the sprite work is by and large excellent, and that holds true for the move effects, some effects seem to take up more time then necessary and when your using them often this can become annoying. This is especially true for some multi hit moves like Heated Horns which have the attack animation play out multiple times for each successful strike. This is in sharp contrast to a move like Multi Bolt which fires off all its successful blasts in lightning (heh) quick fashion. This is more of a nitpick then any deal breaking issue but I don't think it would hurt to trim down some of the animations to keep battles moving along. 3. Linearity: In general the world of Coromon is explored in a mostly straight line. This is something of a slump mainline pokemon games have found themselves in as well. While there are some goodies and quests to find off the beaten path you're going to be on a tight leash as far as the major areas are concerned. Again nothing of a deal breaker but Id love to see a more open world design from this series in the future. 4. Audio Nitpicks: Having nearly every Coromon's cry being its name like Pokemon do in the show was an ambitions choice. For the most part I think they did a good job with shortening/changing/distorting the cry so it sounds more like a creature then a person, but there are a few examples (looking at you Kyraptor) where it definitely feels forced. Coromon having a defeated cry would also would be nice but that's more of a wishlist sort of thing. My other issue with the audio is that certain moves like Poison Sting are way louder then others for some reason. This could be an issue with my machine but I'm honestly not sure. 5. No Trading or Co-op: Trading is something the entire potential and traits system seems to be begging for, and to their credit TRAGsoft has expressed interest in adding it. At time of writing its still absent and is sorrily missed, I got 2 potent Purrgy's and wish I could give one to my friend who is also enjoying the game. Co-op is admittedly a big ask, but it was the highlight for me when playing SWSH. I would also feel a lot better about recommending Coromon to other friends if we had a way to play together that wasn't direct PvP. Maybe remixed Titan battles with friends?6. Bugs: This game still has a few bugs, but the devs are putting out patches to fix them so this is more of an acknowledgement then a complaint. I haven't experienced anything especially disruptive or game breaking but if the notion of bugs is a no deal for you then maybe give it a bit more time.  Final Thoughts Overall Iv really enjoyed my time with Coromon and its great to see a smaller studio make improvements on a formula that the mainstream has gotten a bit too comfortable with (a comparison to Stardew Valley comes to mind). It has a lot of replay value with its customizable difficulty and I can definitely see myself replaying it in the future. I think Coromon is setting off on the right foot and while it has some room to grow I look forward to what it has in store for the future."}, {"username": "FunkMasterChunk", "comment": "I've been loving Coromon.

This game has the potential to beat its inspiration at its own game.I missed the joys of the puzzle type areas of the original Pokemon games as they were a bit of a challenge for 9 year old me. I well remember the playground discussions with other Poke nerds when one of us missed a hidden item or some such.

The difficulty scales up rapidly when you reach end game making most customization of characters not viable.  They cap your level at 60 so you cant grind your way to victory either.  The end game bosses can only be done with a few specific party builds.  Now this is not necessarily bad but can be a bit of a turn off for some.  Personally I like being able to grind my way to being over powered in RPGs but to each there own.If this was all though I wouldn't be leaving this negative review.  The biggest problem is that some end game areas are locked behind being able to win some extremely difficult and over-tuned racing minigame, repeatedly.  From what I've read online all the best armors are locked behind this as well as some end game dungeons.  I have no idea what was going through the Dev's minds when they made this ridiculous racing minigame a requirement."}, {"username": "Otto Raynar", "comment": "I want to love this game.The art is good, the music is great, the exploration is fun, the fight mechanics are unique and interesting.And I fully understand all the positive reviews, because, for the first 15-20 hours or so, this game is fantastic.Until you start getting farther in to itand suddenly every other regular enemy (that the game tells you is of your level, and you should be fighting) is likely to one-shot your entire party with a single skill before you even get a turn if you haven't specialized your entire party into the one specific build that hard-counters that single enemy.There are a ton of fun and interesting classes and potential builds in this game; it's too bad that 90% of them are made entirely useless because the only viable strategy for nearly every fight is to use maximum nukes on the first turn, because no defensive options in the game are strong enough to stop enemies from routinely killing your whole party if you give them more than a single turn to attack.  Having tanking classes and threat mechanics is ultimately pointless when your tank has to spend their turns with threat-generating skills, which means they aren't using their defensive buffs & debuffs, which means they get one-shotted.By the end the message falls pretty flat when the game stops being about freedom and exploration because every fight turns into a puzzle which forces one specific party build as the only functional solution."}, {"username": "The Bard of Hearts", "comment": "This game had such wonderful potential.  The idea of exploration with tactics-like (VERY tactics-like) growth system is fantastic.  All numbers are given to you to understand how and why things happen.  You get several different potential builds.None of those builds matter because you need to continual change your characters into something else to SPECIFICALLY counter the new move and set up of the next routine of mobs.  The exploration is fun... until you continual lose anywhere between 5 mins to 30 minutes of doing nothing but jump-jump-jump and about 57 jumps in... OOPS that one wasn't perfect because I had to guess against the specifically designed optical illusion.  I jumped straight but I guess that one was one tile higher and no way to see that.  Lots of time lost.... again....I don't mind parkour games.  But there is a reason why people who enjoy playing number games don't really enjoy having all their time wasted with a single \"Fail at 99% and lose over 30 minutes of progress\".  I desperately want to recommend this game since to dev came so close to glory.Unfortunately, the ridiculous parkour, gimmicky battles, and frankly just vulgar tone of the dev in this game makes it a no go for me.  Don't waste your money because by the time you realize you haven't hit the \"Real game\" yet, you've spent more than 2 hours getting there thinking this feels fun.  Its not.  And hey maybe you can still play for story reasons... no... there is no story.  So why am I playing this?  Just to piss myself off I guess."}, {"username": "Grammel", "comment": "Alright, so I probably have a little bit left of the game, but I figured I'd take the time to review it now.The number one reason to get this game is, I think, that the exploration is great. There are hidden nooks and crannies everywhere, some with some new item or a shortcut between zones, other with whole brand new zones. Real sense of curiosity in figuring out what's around the next corner, very rewarding to follow your nose. The platforming isn't great, but I think it's a means to an end. Once you understand the tools in your kit, you start seeing all these parts of the level that you could fineagle on up to. Further, there's a little bit of metroidvania in here with unlocking new modes of transport. Only problem with that is that it requires a second or two of menuing in order to access those modes, which can add up.The JRPG stuff is pretty good too. Might not be the best ever, but it's more than solid. Fair few moments where I felt rewarded for my build choices, though in the back half there have been a lot more times where I felt I was just scraping by, even from standard encounters. But it's possible I missed an area, or my builds aren't as good as I thought. If you hate JRPGs, this one is not going to change your mind. Again, though, if you can look past that part, I think you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised.Presentation is mostly serviceable. The graphics do what they need to for the most part, though some of the enemy sprites are good. There were a couple moments where the camera didn't play along, but those didn't feel intentional. The music is mostly good too. There are a couple tracks that are real bangers, there is one track for a later game dungeon which I hate, with most falling in the okay bracket.The story isn't very good. The main thrust with crystals and the grand master feels like the creator has something to say about games and game design, but it's felt too heavy handed. Even if it didn't it's very simplistic. Though the exploration is fantastic, I haven't really found any lore. There are recurring characters which are kind of fun, but your mileage might vary.  Whatever narrative value I've gotten out of this game has been my own mind filling in the blanks of the world or imagining the interactions of my characters.All in all, the game isn't the best thing ever put out, but it's very good. More importantly it's almost unbeatable at this price, and offers a fairly comprehensive demo. The developer is also apparently fairly attentive, as there has been a steady roll of bugfixes and minor changes since release.

It takes everything I've loved about classic party RPGs and imagines it in a new way with the modern sensibilities we see in games like Breath of the Wild and Elden Ring.

It's up to you to explore, learn, and find your way. The game won't tell you what to do or where to go.I highly recommend checking this game out if you like any of the following things:+Mix-and-match class systems from games like Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy Tactics, with a bunch of interesting classes to choose from+Nonlinear open world where you must find things for yourself, similar to BOTW or Elden Ring+3D-platforming that almost becomes relaxing at times, due to its instant-respawn to exactly where you were before you fell+Turn-based party RPG combat with modern quality-of-life improvements such as seeing your attacks' exact damage number, probability to hit percentage, and damage-over-time durations before you commit to doing them+Incredible art musicThis game is strange, and rough around the edges. It will not be for everyone. It does not focus on narrative. You may get lost or frustrated, or killed by an endgame boss you discovered in a secret area long before you're ready to fight it.But there's almost no other RPG like this out there, and so far it's everything I never knew I wanted.

The setting itself is pretty cool and has some fallout wasteland with weird critters and horrible people vibes, but has very little consistency or identifiable factions that anybody could care about. The mishmash of genres and gameplay mechanics do not blend well. Using the fake-genre of 'immersive sim' to describe the experience is an obvious cop-out. Overall this is just a very confused game and makes itself a chore to play while being repeatedly anti-climactic due to bad AI and encounter design. Feature: Build up a character and use them as a party member in subsequent playthrough. Reality: party member AI is so atrocious that their perks and equipment don't matter. They barely do anything and will routinely waste all their AP and whiff easy shots. At best they are a mule for a good piece of equipment that you can use on your present character. They just absorb attention and damage from enemies due to stupid behavior, and force you to use your resources to keep them alive. Feature: Action combat with guns, bows, and melee weapons.Reality: atrocious aiming mechanics, terrible gamefeel, non-working melee, and 3/4ths of perks being useless/unusable. You will spend 90% of your time with either a rifle or a pistol since direct fire from cover solves every combat problem in the game. You will 'Stealth Archer' your way through the game because the combat is just that bad. Let me mention again that melee weapons and perks are awful and don't work.Feature: Engaging story that changes the west based on your choices.Reality: the changes don't matter, and most results of your actions are delivered through text exposition in a list, IE: you did the thing and this happened, you did the other thing and this guy didn't get thing, the news says guy died, rejoice! etc. etc. Feature: Dynamic problem solving, many solutions to many problems.Reality: you will use your rifle or pistol to solve 90% of the problems in the game, since it is faster and easier than sneaking around, and has the same outcome.Feature: Loot! Reality: not really, equipment comes in tiers and is not unique. You increase the tier with collectable items. The performance between a bottom tier and top tier weapon is like 20% more damage, which translates into bigger sneak attacks(important), but isn't really very interesting. Feature: Challenging encounters!Reality: Enemy AI is atrocious. You can shoot a lamp and cause a flame patch on the ground and enemies will simply walk into it over and over until they die. Enemies don't use cover properly. They just strafe around and expose themselves to gunfire while blindly spamming into the abyss. Melee enemies charge you down, but you backpedal as fast as they run, so you just backpedal away while reloading. Enemies will eagerly gather up, watch a piece of dynamite land at their feet, and then not scatter. The AI is non interactive and poorly scripted. The game is devoid of challenging enemy behavior.Feature: Character building via perks and traits!Reality: 80% of the abilities in the game are objectively useless due to being extremely conditional or requiring too much commitment, or having very, very poor AP->damage coefficient compared to other skills. Perks are flat % increases to things like health, stealth damage, reload speed and are of course good, but are just a sort of 'play more do more damage' type of thing. Boring but I guess it does get you to explore.Note on character building: it doesn't really matter, since packs of enemies are so small and encounters are so simple both to complete straight up, or just cheese, that you don't need to build a strong character to do any of it. Just walk in with a rifle and shoot until everything is dead. Pros:-Setting-Some unique story elementsCons:-Controls are awful on both m+k and controller. Radial menu is annoying to use and required.-Junk collecting for money + limited inventory space. Not fun, totally obsolete non-gameplay time consuming chore. Shame on you.-Wildly inconsistent difficulty thanks to bad/no AI for enemies or party members.-Bugs abound. Party members getting stuck on/in terrain, enemies getting stuck and standing still to be shot and die. Thrown weapons going way off target. Etc.-Above failures at feature implementation.-Hideous graphics. Just truly atrocious, really. I'm sure it's possible for something to be gritty and gorey and also have decent fidelity, clarity, and memorability. Whatever they did here wasn't it. The cell-shaded style is definitely a shortcut and it really falls apart up close.-Eat cactus plants, rat skewers, and carrots to heal gunshot wounds. \"Immersive sim\" experience, right?Conclusion: everything would have been forgivable if Weird West was fun to play, but it's not fun to play. It plays like ♥♥♥♥. They somehow made a wild west shooting game where it wasn't fun to shoot people and monsters. All they had to do was make it fun to shoot the bad guys and then build everything else off of that, instead it feels like the action combat is an afterthought.P.S. I don't appreciate the disingenuous developer livestreams where they desperately try to make the mediocre things happening on screen seem 'awesome' or 'wild'. No guys. It's not awesome or wild. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring.

If that name doesn’t moist a set of pants, skip this text.Weird West is a very difficult review for me. The team at WolfEye put a lot of love and creativity in their first game, and it’s clear it had a set vision from the start. The problem is that the game is a fantastically conceptualized idea that has little issues in execution that can eventually become severe dealbreakers. Some of them are relative UI/menu issues that some patches can solve, others are ingrained into the core so much that they can ruin the experience.Finished the game on Hard, with all the playable characters alive, in the “good” ending. 22 hours~ of playtime.I ultimately cannot recommend this game without giving some big asteriks, however it is worth checking out as there are some good merits to it. Buy once it either has some slight adjustments or hopefully content updates. However, despite liking it more than hating it, I feel I am the exception, and cannot encourage the purchase unless it’s on a discount or with good consideration.The greatest strength in display is its setting and world interactivity. This is a bleak, strange and bizzare place, filled with different characters and factions with their own goals and role in a well realized universe that plays its uniqueness completely straight. The world has many ways to be toyed with, and this is where it's root’s shine the most.For the first hours, assuming the controls are not a problem for you (weren’t for me but I admit I am used to unconventional controls) it’s easy to lose yourself and get grounded in the world. While the point of view might make it hard, it’s absolutely possible to get sucked in and enjoy a decent story per character, with a good overarching plot that touches on some seen-before themes with a lot of fresher perspectives. Many characters are decently likable, and in the worst case scenario, it’s possible to just flip them off.The issues arise when you start to take a closer look at its design and execution, with some great ideas working against each other, or are mere inconveniences that adjusting the game menus or giving them small tweaks could have resolved.For one, random encounters and many side missions use the same layouts, over and over. This is clearly used to save resources, which is respectable and understandable, but in particular the mines are a long stretch of map with not much going on in them. They simply get tiresome by the tenth time.A big point is player choice, and on one hand, the game will give you a lot of freedom and accounts for many choices, even when to me a lot of these are very minor in actual impact, but at the same time some elements undermine or remove weight from the moment to moment consequences. Plenty of time in a shootdodge I killed a person AND their vendetta, who swore to scour the earth for vengeance as I was blasting their head off. Following that, a lot of these choices are more things you can “do” rather than things the game encourages or rewards, so in a lot of situations you’re going out your way to follow a really stupid town massacre or stealth-’em-up. To put it in better words, due to the procedural nature of quests, repetitive maps in site content, and the random feel of many systems, the game might feel like it’s discouraging you to actually use them.A great example is the abilities. The action points unload way too quickly, to the point shootdodge becomes a more useful and reliable skill than armor breaking arrows for stealth or turning invisible. The abilities are useful but due to the amount of careful hogging the AP has, you will either be way more reserved or just lean towards some few abilities for comfort.There’s few tricks for stealth saving few select abilities, and there’s almost nothing for non-lethal takedowns, however that’s not as much of an issue in this game.Speaking of abilities, that’s another issue at hand. It’s possible to get your gear from another character later, but new playable protagonists have to unlock their skills from scratch, which is why weapon priorities are almost naturally encouraged to ensure a smooth ride as quick as possible. There is a separate, shared perk level too, that does alleviate some of this frustration at the cost of blundering a bit the difficulty or pacing.And as a last note, loot. I just wish that there were less junk items at a higher price instead of dozens of small 1$ items. Same way, if I have a silver revolver, all copper ones from bodies would automatically convert to ammo, not needing to be scrapped. Firearms sell for little, so it’s usually not worth trying.Things like this build up by the end, to the point I am surprised I still enjoyed the game enough and liked most of my time with it. But when it comes to the question of if I’d recommend it, it’s hard. Assuming it does get fixes and improvements, I will update this review. As it stands now, Weird West is a great set of ideas in a fresh, exciting frontier, that fell just short in the areas that mattered the most, which was the little things."}, {"username": "DappleGrim", "comment": "TLDR: Worth trying if you like ARPGs and the weird western genre, but wait for a sale.It's not an Immersive Sim. It's an ARPG set in the Weird West with discrete areas which you travel between on an overworld map with some random encounters. These encounters are mostly fights or merchants, but there are some narrative ones.It's not a free-wheeling choose-your-own-adventure. It's a branching but still mostly linear story iterating over multiple characters which changes ever so slightly based on your narrative choices and violent choices, since you can kill almost anyone. Each character gets 4 unique unlockable abilities, with standardised abilities unlockable for each weapon type. These do not carry over between characters.Unlockable passive perks carry over between characters as you progress through the story.There are some interesting global mechanics like population decimation (bored? go kill a town) and replenishment for settlements, but it doesn't really impact your play at all unless a sheriff is dead, which prevents you from handing in a bounty until a new one is appointed.I'd place Weird West somewhere between a proof of concept and a completely polished game. It feels like they wanted to do a lot more with it but didn't have the time/money. I really like their ideas though.Overall I really hope that they make a Weird West 2 which builds on this with more RPG elements, more skills/abilities, hopefully more of an interactive, open world, and more of this flavour of weird."}, {"username": "jakeychan877", "comment": "This might be the biggest gaming disappointment of 2022. I was really looking forward to playing this. I love the creative team behind this game, I love the concept of supernatural wild west, and I love immersive sim RPGs. Unfortunately the game developers missed the mark on this one. PROS:- This game has a lot of style. The UI elements, environments, and characters all have unique distinctive designs and does a good job of immersing you into the Weird West. - When the combat works it can be a lot of fun. When you've sneaked and set up a trap and used the games mechanics to pull of crazy stuff it feels great! Unfortunately that is all the praise I have to say for the game. CONS:- The combat the majority of the time is clunky and not very intuitive. I don't really know if the isometric style of gameplay really works with real time stealth and shooting mechanics. Most the time I felt I was fumbling around with the controls. Being 6 hours in and each of the characters having the same control scheme I should not still be fumbling with them. - If there is 1 word I'd say for the combat loop it would be repetitive, it feels like the only real \"Immersive sim\" things they added to the game are kick a barrel and watch it blow up. It sure is fun, but boy it gets old after a while. The game never feels like it encourages me to use any other method other than blow up a barrel or just shoot them. - There is no diversity in the multiple characters. The Bounty Hunter plays exactly the same as The Pigman. Why would a Pigman use a gun?!?!?! Each character should feel distinct from one another and offer gameplay advantages and new scenarios that the other ones can't. You never end up using their special abilities because I hardly ever have mana to do so! And when I do I just die immediately because I am right in the open getting shot by 4 dudes. - The story is not really worth mentioning. Its very boring and doesn't really utilize the Weird West setting at all. Also no voice acting is really crappy. I get its expensive and this is a new smaller studio, but $40 is $40 I should get voice acting for that. Plenty of other indie games have it and are far cheaper. Scale back the dialog if this can't be done.All in all, I think this is a profoundly disappointing experience. Its such a shame because all the pieces are there to make a great game and they just couldn't bring it together. I hope this studio continues to make games, because immersive sims are something of a rarity in these days and I'd like to see them take another shot at it. For now I would not recommend Weird West."}, {"username": "zincowl", "comment": "Aside from few unique selling points that it desperately tries to make you aware of in its tutorials along with somewhat misleading claims to the ever shifting concept of an \"immersive sim\", Weird West is by all accounts a small version of a Bethesda game with familiar genre trappings, albeit more morally unhinged in its story and characters. It has a moderately reactive open world consisting of nearly identical larger towns and small settlements spread out across a map while the main crux of its RPG routine is picking up everything in sight in the fashion of a mole or a vacuum cleaner with the goal of selling it to vendors or crafting. Surprisingly, however, what this game also offers is a mildly satisfying twin-stick shooter with bullet-time, although it is once again undercut by resource based systems that never let the player fully explore neither their arsenal nor the character skills. All the while the tactical aspect of the fights can only be expanded upon through hiring AI companions that expectedly work as distracting cannon fodder, taking away any desire for active participation.What remains is the freedom of approach, which this game reduced mainly to the freedom of who and how to kill. This becomes evident immediately after opening the skill and perk menus that offer to exclusively amplify repetitive exploration activities and weapon handling through gradual percentage increases. This limp fixation on loot and combat continually haunts all 5 available characters all of which are barely distinguishable between one another, which means that even if this game didn't try to sacrifice gameplay variety to serve the story structure by taking the player through their stories in a continuous manner, this variety would still remain barely noticable.All of the above-mentioned observations make the whole experience seem like a confused venn-diagram with Weird West sitting somewhere at the cross-section of \"poor content variety\", \"tired RPG cliches\", \"unrewarding progression\", and \"mediocre shooter\". Makes me wonder what all those big action rpgs would be worth without the pretty views and music they spend so much time and resources on.You know you're in for a treat when you see a \"junk\" section in a game inventory.

Over and over. Some quests are also poorly explained and feature no markers to help you understand what you're supposed to do.- inventory management is a chore; too many small junk items fighting for space with your weapons, utility items and consumables makes looting a frustrating experience.- several poor design decisions, having to sell different items to different merchants, not being able to sell from your horse's saddlebags, pixel hunting small items etc...- both friendly and enemy AIs are very basic and easy to exploit.- the reputation system just gets in the way, do a bounty or help someone in a quest? +5 to +10. Screw up a clunky stealth section and resort to violence or do so to follow what feels like the \"good ending\" of a quest where you defend yourself when attacked by former allies? -40. You're welcome.- bugs, ranging from AI allies doing nothing or turning hostile for no reason whatsoever, a small pause whenever the quest log updates (on a SSD, mind you), a couple crashes, sleeping in a hostile locations making enemies neutral, being stuck in combat etc...Final thoughts: I've played through until the ending cause, I'll be honest, the main plot was pretty interesting and I wanted to see how the story'd end.The whole experience was somewhat fun but too many things get in the way, from the aforementioned weird design decisions, to actual bugs, some awkward quests where you might get stuck, a lot of stuff seems unwieldy or obscure just for the sake of it...but what soured the deal for me was the combat.It works but that's about it, it's a weird mixture of real time action with a bullet time activated ability (which costs mana), a rudimentery cover system and several character and weapon skills.It's just so clunky, whether you're trying to get a decent enough angle to not get your shot blocked by something, trying to activate a skill while dodging or trying to switch weapons (and god forbid you have to use one of the two that's not in the quickbar). All while bullet sponge enemies shoot at you, cast stuff and throw explosives. The friendly AI isn't too much help either, it reacts slowly, it does way less damage than you even with full perks and enemy AI seems to aggro you more than them most of the time anyway.I'll say something that's been in my mind right after spending a few hours with this one, \"wow, this'd have been great with a turn based system whenever combat starts, like the old Fallout games\"."}, {"username": "HawkStone", "comment": "This is a 5/10.  tl;dr Wait for patches and buy on sale.PRO:  A dark story that is unusual in a good way.

Also, this is NOT an immersive sim as advertised(not even close)."}, {"username": "Askebaske", "comment": "Simply can't recommend this game. A big part of the immersive sim genre depends on feeling like everything is part of a curated experience. In Deux Ex/Prey/Dishonored you can learn enemy behavior, patrol patterns, have several different lethal/nonlethal options, several big and small ways to change your method of progress. There is dialogue and meaningful choices and logs and lore and worldbuilding integrated in every encounter. Some encounters might have you face traps, be solved entirely with dialogue, have you take long alternating routes using skills like breaking down walls, teleporting or whatever the game gives you. Isometric RPGs in general go a step further, giving nearly every NPC (including enemies) their own stories, quests and personalities. I hoped (probably stupidly) this might be a sort of mix.This game does absolutely none of that. 99% of the game feels procedurally generated. Every town feels like a copy-paste, every quest/bounty is a fetch/kill quest for random items from random people. Characters, even the main characters, are entirely devoid of meaningful personality. There are very few lore books and newspapers seem procedurally generated. Things happen in the world with seemingly no meaningful connection to your actions. The \"immersive sim\" parts are limited to specific encounters (I saw one in 7 hours of gameplay) and it still boiled down to \"use one of these 4 curated methods to achieve goal A\". Combat is the same corridors towards a target against the same handful of enemies, usually wandering about with no defined patrols, your options being \"non-lethal melee that can fail for god knows what reason\"/\"Stealth kill\"/\"Shoot everything with slow-mo dodge roll\". The longer you play, the more often you will wonder why you don't choose option 3 all the time.There are a lot of other poor design choices (progression in both items and skills is nearly meaningless, difficulty is all over the place, you are not encouraged to engage with a lot of systems because progression is meaningless, companions are TERRIBLE) but the core of the issue remains that an immersive sim NEEDS to feel like a carefully designed playground, the game bouncing different approaches back at you and constantly surprising you, forcing you to adapt. The moment everything is a procedurally generated encounter with the same handful of enemy types, it loses any appeal to me."}], "game_id": "1097350", "game_title": "Weird_West"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "PrimeGlaz", "comment": "Keep on keeping on"}, {"username": "dreadead", "comment": "I've already 100% completed (achievement wise) the original iteration of DS here on steam a little less than 2 years ago, and Director's Cut has now finally arrived. At somewhat of a good time too because I've just now started to get the itch to replay the game from start to finish again. While I haven't gotten to the point to test out all the new endgame toys this edition adds, I have noticed that the starting experience is more streamlined in a good way. The new player experience is a less arduous than before with some more tutorials like on planning out your first route to help with adjusting to the gameplay loop. Also the maser gun and support exoskeleton help ease some of the frustrations in the early game when you're still in the east coast area. This is especially so if you decide to grind it out a bit before moving into the \"mid-game\" so to speak. These additions seamlessly find their way into regular progression and feel like they were always there to begin with.While some people hated and meme'd the product placement with Monster, I really didn't mind and always found Kojima's inclusion of stuff like this more amusing than anything in all his games. But that is gone and replaced by Bridges energy. I think the variety of graphic upscalers like Nvidia's DLSS (The latest version as of release), AMD's FSR, and eventually Intel's XeSS is great and will allow people with older hardware to get a better visual experience while getting more FPS for smoother gameplay. Before with the original we had a more primitive form of DLSS that had some ghosting and visual artifacting issues. Now those are gone and DLSS now mirrors native presentation quality so there's almost no excuse to not have it on since it gives you higher framerates especially if you're playing above 1080p.I also noticed the soundtrack has expanded with more music in some of the ambient moments while trekking the land. They are great additions and match the mood of the other tracks. Not gonna lie I was afraid Hoshino Gen's 'Pop Virus' would be removed for the Director's Cut but it's still here. I always put that on my PCC structures since it's such a catchy J-Pop song haha. That's neither here or there though. Overall from what I can tell the changes are very subtle which in some ways is a good thing because the original DS truth be told was a complete experience already sans the tedious early game. On the other hand it's slightly disappointing because I kind of wanted more. But most of the implementation of what is new from my initial impressions feel like they were thought out and not just tacked on for no reason. As I mentioned the new stuff added so far feels like they were always there which is a good sign progression and immersion wise.I transferred a new save I barely started from the original game and most of the achievements transferred over which is kind of nice. Just some progression stuff I need to grind for because it's a fairly fresh save, which is fine, I was planning on getting those things anyways again in this new playthrough. For people who have had their fill of DS and have no desire of playing again the new stuff isn't really enough to justify coming back. But if you've been itching to play again after being away from the game for awhile Director's Cut will be a fun nostalgic experience with some added bells and whistles. For new players, well this is the only version of DS you can play anyways since the old version got delisted lol. But it is from what I can see the definitive version of the game so it is worth a purchase if you're curious about Death Stranding but haven't gotten a chance to buy/try it yet. Plus the retail price is now only 39.99 USD (Can't speak for regional pricing), but should be discounted nicely in future steam sales. For people who have bought the original DS, you only need to pay 9.99 USD to get this new version. I think it's a fair upgrade price content wise especially considering all of the predatory overpriced DLC out there when it comes to games. So you can buy with confidence old players and new.For a quick and dirty review, DS is a very unique experience to say the least. It's not for everyone but can be both super calming to play and equally suspenseful when you encounter BTs or Mules. The story can sometimes feel a bit overdramatic in a stage theater kind of way, but at the same time it has something genuine and heartwarming to say. The landscapes you'll trek are breathtaking and I think the view distance in Director's Cut is farther than in the original which adds to the scale and makes the world feel even larger. Is DS a walking sim? Why yes it is, the best damn walking sim out there too especially since it actually tries to mechanically simulate walking. MOCAP, and the general acting performance from the star studded cast is immaculate especially in the cinematic cutscenes. Playtime will vary but I would guesstimate for most people 40 - 60 hours depending on how much you engage with the side content or take your time. Also while I love Metal Gear, I think DS is Kojima's best work to date, and is a really special experience. Hope whoever plays DS will find something that resonates with them along the way and \"keep on, keeping on!\""}, {"username": "buy my couch plz", "comment": "Nothing is different these days.

Patrick's Parabox does present some interesting ideas, but doesn't flesh them out enough to create a true sense of increasing difficultly. It took me only 5 hours to beat the game and almost every world to completion, because despite having over 300 levels, many of them are either solved with near identical solutions or the solution is the only set of unique game actions you can take. Despite that, I did enjoy myself and there were a handful of levels I thought were clever, but comparing this game to something like Baba is you is night and day. Which makes the price point of Patrick's Parabox being $20 seem ludicrous to me. I would probably recommend the game if it was $5-$10, but as it stands it unfortunately under delivers. Also on a different note the soundtrack just really does not do it for me, forgettable and annoying."}, {"username": "Charcoal", "comment": "brain is melt"}, {"username": "leonid", "comment": "I pushed around infinities and epsilons and felt like god"}, {"username": "Tater", "comment": "If you don't already own Baba is You I don't recommend you buy this game. I can't give this game a negative review because the concept is so clever and the mechanics are so thoroughly executed, but I felt pretty let down. It took me 9 hours to beat all the 300 main levels, at the time of this review I haven't finished all the challenge levels but I'm not super excited to play them except for the achievement.It only took me about 2 minutes per puzzle but the vast majority of them took far less than that, usually I would quickly finish 2-4 puzzles in a row then spend 15 on one puzzle, but the ones which I spent more time on didn't feel harder I just think I wasn't able to see the solution very quickly. Almost all the puzzles either introduce a new or clever trick, or they make you do that trick multiple times. Sometimes doing it multiple times requires more thinking but often it doesn't. It felt exhausting to finish all the levels, when I spent a long time on one puzzle only to find the clever trick I felt more stupid than accomplished or just lucky after trying nearly every possible way to push the blocks into each other. I think this would probably be a better game if you just took the best 100 levels. It felt like the 300 levels in the game were the first 300 levels ever made and in a hurry. Most of them can't really be adjusted to be better the only way to improve the quality of the levels would be to create another 500 levels then throw away all the ones that aren't excellent. As a quick comparison Baba is You took me about 35 hours to finish 223 puzzles which is about 9 minutes per puzzle. I felt like the hard puzzles where objectively hard and were very satisfying. It's crazy to think that the mechanics from Baba is You and Patrick's Parabox could theoretically overlap perfectly in a single game but that's just a dream at the moment. Anyway here's my final thoughtsPatricks Parabox - 7.5/10 - $20Baba is You - 9.4/10 - $15Sure 9 hours is definitely worth the $20 but I would probably wouldn't be nearly as critical if it was $10."}, {"username": "LIMITLESS POTENTIAL", "comment": "This is the first time in a while that I've felt compelled and capable to 100% a puzzle game on my own.

Puzzles are difficult because of how they re-use and re-contextualize their mechanics, rather than adding additional layers of complexity for the sake of difficulty. Solutions tend not to be particularly long. I think of the 364 puzzles, there was a total of one that I did not understand and had to brute force. That's pretty remarkable!In addition to all that, I think there's a lot of value in playing this game for the first time blind. Every time a new mechanic is introduced, it was a surprise to me - and yet, the mechanic was simple enough that I almost instantly understood it.I do not know if you'll enjoy this game to the end if you're not a puzzle game enjoyer.

I recommend you read the full review for the full detail. This game has a lot going for it!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've waited until the game's full release to write this. As of today I have 179 hours in this, and I've beaten the game 4 times. I think I can write this review pretty confidently lol.I bought this game after seeing Civvie's 2 videos on it. It looked like so much fun I had to try it...before I knew it, it was 2am and I had no intention of stopping. Even now, it remains just as enjoyably addictive. This is just as well, because the game goes on forever. Literally, forever. With the Chapter 3 update, New Game + was implemented, and you can play this game with progressively stronger weapons and enemies for as long as you want. Even if you don't decide to play NG+, you've still got at least 50 hours of levels and bossfights- that's about how long it took me to finish the game for the first time.But what about the details, Mantha, the DETAILS?! Very well: 3 game-modes, 3 minigames, 3 chapters, featuring 80+ levels, with 80+ weapons, and 50 enemies, officially-speaking. Technically, there are 25x as many levels, if you count all their variations (each level has a set of variations you can encounter. If you die and retry a level, the layout will be different), and for the weapons, there's...technically, there's like 1000+. All the different combinations of modifiers (including my favorite, \"Random projectile\") make for very, VERY different weapons. For instance, on one of my saves, I have a shotgun that shoots explosive fireballs. Another shotgun I have uses explosive pellets that deal shock damage. Yet another shotgun I had is able to shoot on automatic, has 3 extra shells, and does ice damage, which can freeze enemies solid. So in reality, the amount of different weapons in Nightmare Reaper is innumerable. As you can probably tell, this aspect of the game is my favorite. I I love collecting new, wild, powerful weapons in games, especially when each one feels and sounds satisfying, as they do in Nightmare Reaper.Speaking of sounds, have you *heard* the soundtrack for this game? Listen to the trailers, watch someone stream the game. The music is fantastic and matches the mood of the dream-based slaughterfest...oh would you look at that, it's by Andrew Hulshult. That explains it. As for other, non-musical sounds, the weapons all sound gorgeous (the sawed-off's alt-fire is how every shotgun should sound), to the point that sometimes I start using a weapon not because it has particularly strong modifiers, but because dammit, I really love the way it sounds. You will also enjoy the sounds of the enemies, who each have various idle sounds, alert sounds, pain sounds, and death sounds, all of which make the killing even more satisfying.How about the graphics? Every game's gotta have shmexy graffix, right? Nightmare Reaper does not disappoint. Its pixel-heavy retro style may put off the zoomers who have no appreciation for art, but for those who understand the uniqueness of old-school sprites and textures, this game delivers. Modern lighting and shading techniques coupled with lovingly-made textures give each level its own particular atmosphere that you simply have to play to fully feel. ...Okay, this section of the review sounds like a snobby game journalist wrote it, but I stand by my words! It looks great. One of my favorite things to do is to sneak up on enemies and just study the way they look. Gaunt, the man responsible for the enemy designs, made some eerily, disgustingly-beautiful creatures.What about the story? What is all this dream stuff about? Why are you in a mental asylum? Who are you? Da ♥♥♥ is going on? If you've read my reviews before you know I abhor spoiling a story, so don't expect any. You play as an unnamed young woman who has lived a...rough life...and has developed some serious mental scarring that's left her with a struggling grip on reality. She experiences vivid nightmares, in which the player can find small clues and hints as to her past, and how she got to this place in her life. During her waking hours, she is left notes by her doctor, which serve to explain the story in more concrete terms. Ultimately, the battle for sanity is fought in her dreams.Lastly, I want to talk about the smaller, less fundamental things. The game has lots of settings, so you can customize graphics, UI, controls, and even gameplay to a fair extent. The minigames act like skill trees, helping you become more powerful and gain new abilities, so they aren't just bland bonus features. There is also an arena mode, where you can take the outrageous weapons you find in the proper levels and test your might against endless waves, while also earning currency to spend in one of the minigame skill trees. There are also secrets to find in the nightmare levels, most containing various references, and upon clearing out a large room of enemies, special \"events\" can occur...some good, some not so good. The game keeps you on your toes! And finally, perhaps the best aspect of this game, its community. The Nightmare Reaper community, specifically the Discord server, is a joy to hang out in and be a part of. It's especially fun talking to the developers...even if the lead dev has some questionable hot takes on movies here and there...and seeing people post clips and images from their experiences in the game. To conclude this lengthy lad of a review...Nightmare Reaper is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome and anyone who enjoys the FPS genre should try it. Seriously, it's that much fun that I can confidently give a broad and sweeping recommendation like that. If you enjoy running around, playing with fun weapons, jumping, shooting, and fighting monsters, you will very likely enjoy this game, especially as the levels grow larger and more complex. It's fun to play, it's full of good music and satisfying sounds, it's got lots of those \"little touches\" that make it all the more enjoyable, and the community surrounding the game is a big ol' family of videogame nerds. What's not to like? :DTo ItBurn: Congrats on finally finishing your passion project. I hope you take a well-earned rest after this.

You own and operate an animal shelter that you can personally name, but there isn't any information about your character's motivations for opening one or why they choose to rescue only dogs and cats, and not any other types of animals.Gameplay AnalysisEvery dog (and cat) has its day.The gameplay elements that are present are exceptionally clean and well-thought-out. Unfortunately, the clear downfall is that there aren't many of them. You will begin the game following a rather basic tutorial of how things work: ordering food and water, buying cleaning utensils, taking pictures of the pet, playing with, and looking after them, etc. All of this with the expectation that they will become happier and healthier and eventually be ready to go to a good home that you have personally selected.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790210259Once you have fare-welled your first animal (be they a cat or dog, as you get the choice at the beginning), you expect the game to open up and provide you with some kind-of fleshed-out experience with plenty of progression and customisation. And that is where the game loses any traction as there is nothing more to it. The only decent addition is that you get limited control over how the shelter will expand, but that's more like fluff content than anything substantial to challenge you, as the customisation of the facility is extremely basic. These upgrades only really serve to make your more gruelling tasks a lot easier and don't add any more things to manage.The only major aspect that I thought might provide some variance to the otherwise stale loop was the animal behaviours, where some are energetic, some are aggressive, and so on. It was seemingly a forgotten mechanic as it doesn't play any part in looking after the pet at all. Every animal you take in will have the same generic AI and doesn't change in the slightest during the entire playtime. The only thing this does for you is that it helps you choose the type of home it should go to, and that is it.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790210577Audio and VisualFrom a visual standpoint, Animal Shelter has a lot going for it. The environments are detailed and engaging, and the surrounding nature is eye-catching, with lush and highly-detailed foliage decorating the horizon in all directions. And then you go to your loving new companion, and they look like someone glued fur to a pig hoping to trick you into rescuing it. It is such an ordeal, that something as simple as trying to get a decent photo of them for the website is a nightmare all on its own.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790210441The audio isn't a whole lot better. A bland and flavourless soundboard has been used here with a limited scope of variance. All the dogs sound the same, and all the animation effects sound recycled and empty of any real depth. You get the immediate impression that they weren't recorded for a simulation-style experience. The soundtrack is perhaps the only positive aspect here, as it is soothing and provides you with a tranquil experience as you potter around doing whatever you plan to do for the day.PC Performance and SpecificationsWith the game set to the highest possible settings, I never noticed the framerate drop below 60. There was a surprisingly limited quantity of bugs and glitches during this experience, but I did have at least two crashes in the frame of approximately 5 hours.🟧 Graphical quality is mediocre even at the highest setting.🟨 A couple of early crashes made it hard to want to invest time.RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 34%)CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 37%)GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 40.4%)Final Thoughts - BorderlineReview chart here.Animal Shelter isn't going to win any awards for simulator of the year, that's for sure. But the overall experience isn't terrible, it lacks any significant graphical polish or gameplay mechanic that will help break the monotonous loop, but it is a very soothing experience that gives a good insight into what it's like to work in a real animal shelter. I think this game would benefit from some kind-of customisation and varying gameplay, but at the moment, it just doesn't support it.I cannot recommend buying this game at full price, as it simply isn't a full game (yet?). I can, however, happily recommend it to an animal lover who can find it at a severe discount.Follow our Curator page,  Summit Reviews  , to see more high-quality reviews regularly."}, {"username": "GinaTonik", "comment": "Challenge: Very lowAchievements: EasySound: BadTech trees/advancement?: Not really but yesGraphics: Pretty💜 This game was gifted to Catizens Curations for review.This is a game for fans of these super realistic simulators. This game has some cute animations and being able to name the animals and interact with them will please pet fans. Still, this game is meant with realism in mind and there may be some moments that are sad for those who are more sensitive to the realities of our pet problem.For many, the game may be too realistic and will provide only a short time of enjoyment unless you have a niche interest in the subject. There are different simulator games for you out there.I did not encounter any bugs except sometimes the cats would not play with my laser pointer so I had to enter my inventory and exit to get them to pay attention again.I recommend it merely because there are fans of the genre it will please and because it has the good message of spay or neuter your animal to reduce the pet populations!🐾 Check out Catizens Curations for more pet games!"}, {"username": "Dantor", "comment": "Sadly, I can only give this game a negative review. As much as I admire the good intentions in this game, it is unfortunately absolutely inadequately created.It starts with the fact that you don't get to see any people in this game. The interaction with the new pet owners is only done via the PC. And there you spend a lot of time, if you really want to find the right new owner. A lot of time!Normally the interactions with the animals are limited to feeding, giving water, petting or throwing the ball, waiting for the poop to be made and washing. Especially with the dogs being pack animals, I would have expected them to play with each other if you let them out in the run together - but nothing. The dogs also do not lie down in their dog beds so far.... well, it's daytime all the time anyway. Oh, and there is of course no daily routine, so fixed feeding times, for example. For sick, malnourished or too fat animals can be important.And my biggest criticism: You have to do everything alone! There is no support, no employees, no volunteers to walk the dogs, as is usual at least in local animal shelters (Germany). There are also no visitors, no adoption events like some shelters like to host.The game is really very repetitive: animal arrives, take care of it in the cage, have a short time outdoor, take a picture, place an ad, find a suitable owner, put the dog in the car - and the next one.In short, it gets boring quickly.There are many tasks in an animal shelter that you can do yourself and also delegate to others. But not in the way it is presented here. Sadly."}, {"username": "Blue Elite", "comment": "Dog/Cat poop cleanup simulator. Also laser pointers for cats.

This game is worth the time and money and is fun for all ages"}, {"username": "Jellybean", "comment": "I thought I'd give this a fair crack of the whip and play for a good few hours before writing a review (giving myself chance to open up different buildings etc..) but I have to say i'm not overly impressed.I purchased this (being a massive supporter of animal charities) because there was a donation to charity(ies) included so I will give massive kudos for that, but for anyone just buying for a bit of fun. I'd say to think carefully.It's hellacute for the first half hour, but soon becomes tiresome and repetitive. You're basically a one man band, you have to do everything yourself without the ability to employ staff/volunteers to aid you. You can only adopt one animal at a time. Your day consists of living on a computer to either find information/shop/build. All animals are recolours of the same dog/cat, over and over.The game is a constant repetition of : Find animal>feed animal>pat animal>throw ball/play with laser> clean up poop> take photo> scan photo> place ad> find suitable match (this takes an AGE)> handover animal. Rinse and repeat. Over and over and over and over again. You may get the odd illness or wash thrown in, but that's about it.Not sure if its a bug for everyone, but I have found that you don't always receive everything you have purchased once you 'take all' from the delivery box and should you move any of your buildings, you find the majority of your stuff has gone missing and has to be repurchased. I've also found that the game freezes intermittently while carrying animals.I don't want to be too harsh on it, I've played much much worse and I do think that there is definitely a market for older children/young teens here, but i'd be inclined to say that you can actually have more fun playing sims pets than this. After the first 15-20 minutes of the game, you've pretty much done it all."}, {"username": "Midplayz", "comment": "Animal ShelterT O O  M U C H  C U T E N E S S ! !Almost all the games I play are filled with violence. On the other hand, Animal Shelter overflows with wholesome vibes only. It was a completely different experience from the usual bloodshed & slaughter games. This game was very exciting to play at first. But after the game shows you all its trump cards, it starts becoming repetitive & boring. Well, at least for me it did. You might have a completely different take on this game! It was nice to see the developers donating 10 grand from their income to animal shelters in real life! My hope for humanity is restored.About This Game Storyline There’s no storyline for the game. You just have objectives to achieve. You take in dogs/cats, tend to them then put them up for adoption. You just have to repeat this over & over again. Yes, there is variety in the dogs & cats since they have different characteristics & varying needs & wants. But the core gameplay feels very repetitive.Gameplay Mechanics I am sure you guys would've played at least one of those “Simulator” games. Well, if you didn’t, lemme explain it a bit. These games try to replicate the experience of a particular job in most cases. For instance, this game gives the player insight into how it feels to own an Animal Shelter. It might not be very accurate but it covers the basics. When you start this game, you get thrown into a tutorial. This lasts for a long time as the game has a lot of features. The game goes something like this: You have to first choose what animal you want to start with; A dog or a cat.  After choosing, you spawn into the game’s world. A van brings in your first stray animal.  Each animal you get has different characteristics & varying needs & wants. As an Animal Shelter, you have to tend to these needs & wants to make the animal happy.  These may include food, water, medical attention, clean up, playing with it, etc. Catering to these needs will improve the dog’s physical & mental health allowing you to put it up for adoption.  You need to buy a camera to take pictures of the dogs which will then be uploaded along with the advert for its adoption. After uploading the Advertisement, you play the waiting game waiting for the perfect client to adopt the dog. This is decided by comparing the traits & features of both, the dog & the client. The more they have in common, the more reputation points you get. You can send a person from your animal shelter to go & investigate the client for more information.  Through the computer, you can choose each animal you want to take in. After selecting, the same blue van will come & deliver the pets to you.  Then the game basically repeats these steps.So, that’s basically how you play the game. It’s repetitive after a while but you can never get enough of these fluffy animals! The interactions are very cute. You can play with the animals & even pet them. What surprised me is that you can pet the animal after placing it in the van which will take them to the new owner. It’s a very emotional detail if you get emotionally attached to one of the pets. Some animals you get will either have an injury or will be sick. You can treat them at the med bay if they are injured. If they are sick, you have to take a blood sample & submit it to the Vet who will send you a prescription of what you need to use to heal that animal. Money management is very important. It’s best to buy supplies whenever you need them since the drone delivers them in 10 seconds. I really love how they used drones to deliver stuff in disposable cardboard boxes which can also be used as storage for extra stuff. You can get expansion tickets by earning reputation stars. These tickets can be used to expand the area of your animal shelter, allowing you to build more buildings. You will need more dog & cat enclosures if you are going to be taking in a lot of them!See, there are a lot of things you can do but the game still gets stale after the tutorial. There are also a few bugs you will encounter like disappearing items, animals clipping through walls, etc. Some mechanics like picking up the animals, the dogs chasing the ball, etc feel a bit too janky. I am sure they will slowly rectify all the bugs & glitches the game has!Visuals & AudioThe visuals aren’t that appealing but animals look cute in any resolution! The game feels low poly. The animations of the animals are very cute! I love how the dogs react when petting them & how the cats chase the lasers. What’s really appealing is the usage of drawings of cute dogs & cats on the loading screen & a drawing of a sad cat & dog in the pause menu with a speech bubble that has “YOU GOIN’, FREN?”. It’s so cute & sad at the same time. Doesn’t allow me to exit the game, hence why I just Alt-F4. In conclusion, the game's visuals are not that great & could use some polishing. On the other hand, their UI design is pretty eye-catching.I forgot to mention that the game gives pretty low FPS. I guess the developers haven’t properly optimized the game. It overheats my laptop & has a lot of FPS drops. Please look into this!Sound design, there’s nothing much apart from Background music, animals barking or meowing, the honk of the van & the whirring of the blades of the Quadcopter. All of them have been perfectly implemented!Pros Cute animals. I love the animations that the dogs & cats have. They’re just adorable. A lot of content. The game is endless. It’s a bit detailed as it takes into account the basic needs of the animals.  The graphics are decent. The animals look low poly when compared to the other hard surface assets, but they oddly suit the game’s vibes. Cons Gameplay gets repetitive & stale real quick.  Few bugs & glitches, no game is perfect.ConclusionI needed a cute & wholesome break and this game gave that to me. I honestly had fun while playing it although I got bored of it. I will surely go back to the game in the future though. Kudos to this indie dev for making a pretty good game! I recommend giving it a shot if you love dogs & cats. In my opinion, the game is not worth the base price. Try grabbing it at a sale. If they add more content that doesn’t allow the game to become stale quickly, then it would be worth the $19.99!Reviewer: MidplayzDogs come when they’re called; cats take the message & get back to you later…Rating: 8/10 Please follow United Critics for more quality reviews."}, {"username": "lollipoppedchainsaw", "comment": "I really wanted to like this game, but there are so many game breaking bugs that just ruin the experience.

The price of around 17€ is reasonable for this content amount, however this doesn't matter when all the other issues come into play.Verdict: BadRating Chart HereAn insipid, soulless, generic farming sim that, despite years in Early Access, is still far from the quality standards of a full release.

Shocking!In NPLH you'll play as Ellen, an aspiring Mars colonist that decides to go back to an ecologically-ruined Earth and start a new life, trying to set things right instead of abandoning the planet, alongside her grandfather. Turns out the old man disappeared, so you'll have to help out the few locals that chose staying behind like him, and understand what happened to him. Heaps of trash and crazed robots dominate most landscapes, a result of mankind's outrageous conduct; despite the premise, the settings aren't bleak at all between cute animals (sometimes sentient, for a dash of fantasy...) and bright colors. If this is the post-apocalypse, it doesn't look too grim;  lore and writing feel rather generic, as none of the characters or quests will stick in your mind or really hook players at any point - mostly uneventful.A Woman of Many TalentsYou'll be doing mainly two things in this title: clearing each area from trash using your industrial drills and vacuum, and manage the farm. Despite the biome variations, each area plays out exactly in the same way: (slowly) clear trash, collect everything that drops, open chests, push buttons to open gates, bash robots that attack you... always the same two types, slow, weak, badly animated and with death having no penalty whatsoever. There's no variety, be it in the first or last areas, except the occasional timed buttons or mini puzzle: highly-unusual findings. Quests for NPCs mainly consist in gathering X amount of a resource, going from point A to point B or helping X amount of animals by feeding or herding them - also in this case, missions feel too similar and have no interesting variations at any point.A good number of upgrades like increased vacuum range, drills potency, etc. can be purchased using Preserved Food (currency) alongside specific resources (mostly farm products) - they're marginal improvements that aren't really needed given how miserable enemies are; they won't make the cleaning ops much faster either, except when they allow breaking harder mounds of trash, which is mandatory to progress past some areas.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2782502164No Time For Friends, Sigma Grindset Engaged!Most farming sims have relations or even romance options with the various characters, other than activities to do alongside them; let's take the famous Stardew Valley, or My Time at Portia as references, to name a couple. Here there is none of that: NPCs act as glorified, static quest \"dispensers\" with some random dialogue options for lore's sake, and integrated shops for new machines / facilities for the farm. This completely cuts out any attachment the player may hope to develop towards the characters, and makes the story as a whole, a glorified series of chores.The Painful Life of Post-Apocalypse FarmersWhile it's initially satisfying to set up your own farm freely, or renovating gramps' old house with furniture, wall paper and other amenities, soon the farming side of things will take an annoying, bleak turn indeed. with the locations divided in \"compartments\" instead of a smooth open-world, you'll end up without space for facilities end crops, thus develop your farm over several \"sections\" of the world with a loading screen between each. The normal quality-of-life basic systems such as auto-sorting or auto-stacking are absent, chests can't be marked or named, animals clip into each other and have to be manually harvested for resources - very fun when you have 45 chickens and 30 pigs in five square meters. This all amounts to a tremendous slog of fidgeting with interfaces half the time, misclicks and general annoyance.The farm isn't even that engaging to take care of: crops won't die if you forget to water them, rather not grow. Animals are self-feeding and immortal; automatic systems to water everything are unlocked soon enough, so you can stay away for days without caring, and just go back to dump loot when your backpack is full. Cooking is completely useless, as processing raw materials is just faster to gain Preserved Food, while Trash to recycle is ever-abundant - you won't need the various buffs (speed, damage etc.) food gives anyway, given how easy combat is. The various Tier 2 and 3 machines, expensive and locked behind blueprints, are just redundant and not worth the hassle, as you can build five Tier 1 machines, recyclers to name one, and get the same (or better in some cases) efficiency for half the total cost. Once you set up fields, facilities and everything, even just Tier 1, you are already as good as done with the farm, no more meaningful evolution from that point onward... just redundancies.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783504114All The Wrong Choices Led to ThisYou can see the lines between the various \"tiles\" that compose the map. Fall through the map itself at times, get stuck in collisions and have to fast-travel back to fix yourself. Animations? What are those? Better make that gate just disappear as soon as the button is pressed, same for huge blocks of ice, boulders or you-name-it. Break enough trash in an area and see your FPS plummet even with a high-end GPU, as each bit of trash is a standalone physics-enabled object, all with Playstation 2-era graphics, amazing! Did I mention the main quest broke permanently, barring me from finishing the game? Yeah, that should give you the idea of this \"1.0\" release's state."}, {"username": "Xanthelei", "comment": "TLDR: I can't recommend it in the state it's in right now, which is a shame. It's a cool concept, but poorly implemented at the moment. Settings are wonky, controls feel sluggish, there's some serious problems with seeing the attack zones of enemies (and I'm not color blind, so if I'm struggling with it people who are red/green colorblind are going to have huge issues), quests seemed to trigger out of order, and one I was on refused to finish. I hope these issues get addressed, and I will definitely be checking in at a later date, but for now it's very much \"early access.\"The good: It's cute. Everything about it is cute, and it has a decent sense of humor without reaching an \"oh god why\" level. The music is pretty good, and the sounds fit what you're doing. I consider it a good thing when I can turn off the music and not feel the rest of the soundscape is distracting.The meh: The gameplay (at least as far as I got) seems very shallow. Plant crops, water them, harvest. Befriend animal, wait, harvest from it, fill whatever need it has, then wait again. Drill pile of junk, suck up loose trash, put into recycler and wait. Use the currency you get from that to build new buildings. Buy new buildings with food preserved from what you grew. The foundation for a simple but enjoyable gameplay loop is there, it's just unpolished and maybe unfinished. Expect your first few days to fairly slow on the \"getting stuff done\" front. (And be sure to go into the house to sleep away the night. That wasn't explained to me, I stumbled on it after walking past the stairs and seeing them light up.)The bad: Pacing is off - I either encountered things far earlier than I was introduced to them, or discovered things long before the quest meant to tell me they existed, and some things just outright were not explained to me at all. I don't mind a game that lets me just go explore, but it didn't set itself up as such through the quest system. The moment you enter the farm area, you're told to talk to an NPC and begin their quest line, with no hint that nothing is (as far as I could tell) locked behind finishing it, and all the implication that you need to do this before you can do anything else. Controls are sluggish at times and you WILL need to fix the mouse sensitivity as soon as you load up the game - it doesn't default to 1 for some reason.End TLDRControls: It feels like it's optimized for controller right now, but it defaults to mouse and keyboard even with a controller plugged in. Mouse sensitivity is set incredibly low, and it's split between the X and Y axis. For some reason I started out with both X and Y set to 0.3, and I ended up feeling ok with 1.5 but probably could have taken it to 2.0 for better results. Unfortunately, mouse sensitivity does nothing for movement controls. All of that is thrown out the window when you activate your drill, though - tank controls engage, including incredibly slow movement. Reach of the drill is *just* short enough you can't finish off a junk pile without moving, and there's *just* enough of a delay between letting up and it actually turning off that quick reactions to get out of the way of an enemy attack is spotty at best. That assumes you can see the attack icons, though - I had things set to Medium and they all blended into the ground, even the red icon. I only spotted the green icon when I knew there was an attack coming and where I should be looking for it - there's no way I would have seen it otherwise. I feel for anyone who is red/green colorblind and trying to play this game.The default keybind mapping is odd and threw me off at first, then just annoyed me. The only standard keybinds are M for the map, and 1-0 for your hotbar. There is no jump, but instead of leaving spacebar unbound it's defaulted to \"vacuum\" instead. Your mileage may vary, but I was ready to change the bind by the end of my 1.5 hours because I kept doing my usual \"jump when I'm walking somewhere\" thing and annoying myself with the sound. Both E and R are used for very common actions, but I didn't notice Q doing anything for some reason. Tab is your menu key, but annoyingly messes with the Shift + Tab bind to bring up the Steam overlay. I had a few times where it cancelled the overlay and only brought up my menu, which was not what I wanted.Oh and the mouse cursor is captive to the screen in all window settings, at least when I played. I didn't see a way to turn that off, and so needed the Steam overlay to escape the window without alt tabbing completely. Hopefully this QOL bit will change at some point, but it's common enough I don't really think it's a deal breaker, just something worth mentioning.Pacing: A good portion of what is a deal breaker to me is the pacing. When you start, you find a ton of junk that is very satisfying to clean up, but you have very little direction to do so. Your first quest is to put down a chicken coop and befriend 5 chickens. Nothing is said about the potatoes you can plant, or how you'll want to get those going early on so you have 5 potatoes to befriend said chickens. Likewise, nothing is said about the piles of junk or any of the obviously special crafting materials you'll be getting from cleaning them up. Turns out most (all?) of those are quest items for later! While it's good that you can get them even before getting the quest to collect them, I have to wonder why you are required to clean up so much of the junk just to find all the chickens if you're going to be getting quests for these items later. Quest items jumping ahead of the quest feels... odd.I also completed a quest to put a hat on a chicken before receiving it - and got the \"quest finished\" dialogue pop up, which confused me because I had thought I'd just discovered a cute cosmetic mechanic. Thankfully doing so didn't break the quest chain, despite 'turning in' that quest before being told to go do it.The quest that did break, and that finally frustrated me enough to just quit, was the \"bring proof you've befriended a chicken\" quest. I have eggs, I have a chicken feather, but neither of them in any combination will complete the quest. There is zero help for what else you might need to do, even when you go back and ask for a reminder or hint. The quest log didn't have anything useful, either. So either it's broken here, or so vague about a specific that I just couldn't find what it wanted from me. Either one is not good.I'll be watching to see where this goes, but there's enough small issues adding up to keep me from enjoying it overall."}, {"username": "Ishvii", "comment": "I try to support / give the benefit of the doubt to one man indie studios - but in the case of No Place Like Home it just isn't polished enough to recommend. A complete lack of any QA and testing really shows, but it could have been good maybe with another few months of development or another pair of eyes. It's a farming game, but set in a sort of WALL-E era Earth where there's piles of junk cluttering every inch of the map. The mechanics revolve around clearing the junk, watering plants & animals, then turning your produce into currency to buy upgrades. A good loop and fairly relaxing if you can see past the flaws, but there are just too many of those to bother finishing it.Pros- Hoovering up rubbish is cathartic, but repetitive- You're equipped with a vacuum / hose - which is used to clear rubbish, attack enemies and water crops- Some quests clean up the landscape - actually completely change the colour scheme from dirty brown to fresh green and update all the buildings & decor. Seeing your efforts have an effect is really nice- The areas are beautiful- Fast travel system- Relaxing gameplay loop of clearing trash, farming crops and feeding animals- A decent amount of buildings- An upgrade systemCons- On first boot, mouse sensitivity is super low and may put a lot of people off- The controls for hoovering, planting and collecting plants, interacting with animals are really clunky- The interface lacks polish. When talking to NPCs, sometimes the hover effects on the buttons for dialogue choices don't work, and the continue / interact buttons are in different places- There are no seasons, so ending a day and starting a new one has literally no down side and just fast forwards time- Lots and lots of instances / loading screens- No Steam achievements- You can only cook one of a meal at a time. This is tedious if you're trying to cook 10, or say 50 meals to get currency- Lots of invisible walls- You can't interact with anything even a tiny bit higher or lower than you. There are very few completely flat areas, which means lots of moving up and down trying to get to the right level to interact with somethingBugs- The biggest one here is spelling and grammar mistakes all over the place. Even in the first few dialogues I noticed: \"peet food\", \"turn it int to\", \"fast travel tunels\", \"prepaer some cusine\". \"I will give you a Kennel build it mon the farm\", \"becasue\", \"sotries\" and \"piggy buisness\"- Multiple music tracks sometimes play at the same time- Music abruptly stops when you start talking to some NPCs- Quests can be done out of order. I found Harold and got him to be a client of the shop before Mark asked me to do it. Then - Harold asked me to rebuild his house, standing in front of his brand new house- The performance could be better. It's generally really bad when there's a lot of trash on the screen, and my main motivator for tidying the whole map is to improve the FPS- There's an enemy robot permanently stuck inside Harold's home as I could click on the house before the enemies were killed- Animals on the farm get stuck on their pens and on the other side of fences, if their pen is against a fence- Sometimes, no matter what you're hovering over, the game shows you a tooltip for the same item. You pick up whatever tooltip it's showing, which means no matter what I'm hovering over, it will pick up a potato"}, {"username": "svenevil", "comment": "Review by  Gaming Masterpieces   - The greatest games of all time on Steam. Is this game a masterpiece? No, but it is a cute, relaxing fantasy farming game in Early Access. Start either with everything available from the start, or in adventure mode with easy and casual gameplay. So, where IS the challenge mode? I guess there is none, this is not that kind of game. So what is it? Well, you run around with an enormous tool. Kind of a vacuum claener, water hose and jack-hammer in one. You break up stuff, suck it into your inventory and put it in a recycler to build new stuff. You befriend animals to receive eggs, and find blueprints to craft new things. Your aim is to build and run a farm. Or a zen garden. Everything is full of trash, so you have to collect trash, recycle it, craft tons of items, cook food, plant seeds and water them... kind of a survival game without the survival part. Talk with animals, kill hostile (battery-run) animals, construct new buildings and furniture. You'll soon dicover new areas, all completely destroyed by humanity. Your goal is to restore them back to their original beauty, without trash and poison around. Wish this would be so easy in real life.   Conclusion:Casual, zen-like farming and building game.

Depending on which mode you use it can be super chill or satisfyingly challenging. If you want to focus on decoration and funny hats for your animals, you can.

The game is enjoyable and chill, you can't really lose, but you can experience set-backs. I've been playing this game since it's first version in early access, and I've seen it develop and change over time. The devs are active and receptive to feedback, which is good because the game did have quite a few bugs and balance issues. MOST of those are fixed now, though at time of writing the game has only just gone 'full release' so there will probably be a couple bugs introduced with that update.

It should not even be in full release before the majority of them are fixed tbh, the release was too rushed.-The controls feel awkward and clunky (even after they allegedly \"fixed\" some of it)-It is FAR too easy, with almost 80% of enemies/trash piles and explorable stuff removed since I tried it in early access, and on top of that it is also far too unbalanced with collecting quest items and resources (which you find too many of in almost all cases)-Trash piles randomly get stuck under ground or in the air and you can not reach them, as your drill and vacuum can not be tilted up or down (in most cases this is fixed by buying the best vacuum and going at it from weird angles to try and reach it, but is still a bug which should not happen)-You can literally soft lock your game on too many quests, because the game either does not register you do something for a quest (in case of 2 quests in the desert for example, where it does not register you putting stuff down or fixing something and is not resettable, of course) or it outright DESPAWNS THE QUEST ITEM (had that happen 2 times in Lonely Hills with the quest trash piles, that are only there for the quest, which despawned right after the quest for it was started so they could not be cleaned, thank you for that...)-Farm fields that are placed can lead to you falling through the map when you run over them (happens occasionally, no clue as to why and it also does not seem to matter where or how you place them)-The hitboxes for Animals, plants and enemies are badly placed and extremely frustrating, especially with your pet for which the hitbox seems to be floating somewhere above it, where you can trigger it (when you are lucky and look at the pet from the \"right angle\", wherever that is at the moment)- The story is just, disappointing really. The concept is ok, but there is nothing in it that makes it interesting and the changes from early acces to the \"full release\" also took it down a fair bit.This are only the major bugs I noticed in the 6 times I had to restart from a new save, as my game got soft locked by them, and frankly I don't have the patience or will to start over again to list every single one.The game has potential, yes, but it is not at all worth the price it stands at for the content you get. I bought it in early access for around 10€, which it was worth at that time from my perspective, as it was really fun and satisfying (even though a bit monotonous after a while, but I digress), but since the \"full release\" it dropped in value in comparison. From all the features that were removed ,which made the game more fun to explore, and with even more bugs than what it had in early access, sadly.If you want to try the game I would suggest to wait until they finally fixed all the major issues and then some (hopefully) or wait for a major discount, otherwise I would not waste my money on it."}, {"username": "Itachi", "comment": "Terrible mouse controls, seems to be the opposite of mouse acceleration but cannot be turned off.The faster you move your mouse, the slower your view moves and vice versa."}, {"username": "Nalurah", "comment": "I got this game recently and I genuinely love it.

The levels and character designs are so full of charm and interesting ideas, but ultimately the combat is just incredibly unenjoyable, even for someone like me who actually finished the entirety of Dark Souls.

And of course it takes me anywhere from 4 to 15 hits to take down an enemy sometimes. Usually 4, but when it gets higher than that, it gets incredibly tedious.

There is Pokemon, with IV breeding, Sonic Adventure with the Chao Garden, Planet Zoo... and then there is Wobbledogs.Wobbledogs scratches that itch in a way that the other games can't. At first glance the game doesn't look like much. It's very rectangular, very wobbly, the music is repetitive, and there isn't a significant amount to do. But it makes up for what it lacks in sheer number of legs. See, the point of the game is to crossbreed the lovable near-gelatinous dogs over and over until you've created an abomination worthy of its own entry in the Monster Manual, and from what I have seen the community is still debating on if there are any limitations besides your own hardware. You can just keep breeding more legs onto them. More heads. More tails. Or have a dog with 3 heads, one wing and no legs. I bred a table once.While the dogs(?) aren't having their DNA shoved into a breeding simulation machine of questionable reliability, they live in very cute and customizable habitat cubes that can be connected with hamster tunnels. Furniture items can be easily unlocked by capsule balls that are... dropped by your dogs(?), and there are many ways to create unique and fun habitats.Wobbledogs are also virtual pets requiring care and attention. You need to feed them, clean up their excretions, pupate them as they come of age, and account for their mobility issues as you breed them into non-functionality. What you feed them has an impact on how they grow and mutate, so you do need to take care with their diet. Your reward for this hard work is a single unfertilized egg, which can be used to make more abominations. After that they either live in storage for all eternity, or they exist until they die. If they die after you did a good job taking care of them, it rewards your other dogs(?) with a \"feast\". Actually it does that if you did a bad job. This game isn't very punishing.There is a very simple way to save and share your dogs, so you and your friends (or random strangers) can crossbreed your unique abominations together into some sort of obscene collaboration.Overall this is a really fun and addicting game. The art style grew on me, like extra legs, and the gameplay is simple and doesn't have much depth, but it is entertaining enough to hold my attention.

I'm going to list some missing features, inaccuracies that are inexcusable, and other things I've noticed that..I just can't justify.No D-Generation X.  The music is not there, HHH's entrance motion isn't there that I've seen, no entrance video.  I can forgive them removing custom entrances for a year \"because it caused bugs in 2k20\", but why remove options and templates for superstars still in the game?No retro versions of characters already in the game in other forms.  We have current Kane, but not retro.  We have current bald HHH, but no long haired 90's or 2000's version.  We have 2006 HBK, but no 97-98.  All of these characters were in last years game...Which...brings me to the reason I've seen that they've been removed.Myfaction.  They have removed these aspects of the game to place them exclusively in Myfaction mode.  You can't use 2001 HHH in universe, but you can pay real money or spend countless hours to play as him in their card based, pay to win or grind it out mode.  To me this is the ultimate greedy money grab technique, and has me wanting to boycot this franchise.Jeff Hardy's music no longer aligns with his entrance motions when he begins dancing.  HHH's music no longer aligns with him spitting the water.  Why?  That was a detail that has been right in EVERY SINGLE wrestling game for years, all the way back to the ps2.  Why is that suddenly wrong?MyGM is back, but extremeley limited.  No secondary titles, only a men's a women's title with limited matches per card.  If I literally can't have a mid-card title, I just don't see the point in a watered down version.Most of the DLC wrestlers have literally been in the game, some as recent as 2k19 or even 2k20, yet now I have to pay to have them again?  YOU LITERALLY REMOVED WRESTLERS FROM THIS GAME FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT, TO HAVE THEM AS DLC?  Rob Van Damn, Yokozuna, The British Bulldog and others have all been in recently, and I can't believe I haven't seen these things being complained about in other places.As far as the gameplay goes, not having a single counter button and having to match to what type of grapple they are doing makes it to where I can't keep my finger on a single \"no\" button as I call it, and just perfect the timing and instantly counter everything thrown at me.  It makes matches a bit more challenging, and something I've enjoyed.  I DO NOT agree with their claims that the controls have been simplified this year to allow more people to pick up and play.  Perhaps it's that I've mastered them in years past, but this control scheme seems more complicated than every, though I've gotten used to it.I have ran into some bugs and random crashes.  Hollywood Hogan's leg drop finisher does no damage and is difficult to get a win with.  I've had my finisher bar freeze so that I can no longer tell how much momentum I have.  Downloaded arenas off of Community Creations do not show up when I try and select them in Exhibition mode, but they are there when I try and put them on a show in Universe.In conclusion, if all of these little..off details don't bother you, then by all means, get this game.  Enjoy.  Just don't pay them a DIME on Myfaction, and be wary if you are like me, a long time series fan looking for details that you just expect a game like this to have.  Again, absolutely no reason to have HHH, HBK, Chyna and X-Pac in a video game, but no D-X entrance.  Inexcusable.  Happy wrasslin', friends!"}, {"username": "kingdom", "comment": "A step in the right direction for sure - But by itself It's not an amazing game like people say it is, just an okay one.I honestly heavily believe the majority of people raving about how good this game is are in a honeymoon phase. 2K20 was an awful game and I think the wrestling games community would treat anything even slightly better with the praise that 2K22 has. I'll admit, there was a honeymoon phase for me, too, and I was VERY hyped for this game, since the development team seemed so proud of the product they created with how much promotional content they uploaded leading up to the release of this gameMy summary of this review is that 2K22 is definitely a step in the right direction - The gameplay was overhauled to be fast and seamless, with a lot of the strikes and moves flowing into eachother and rarely is there any janky movement. With the focus on combos, you can press any random sequence of buttons and get something awesome to happen, it makes just about any match a clinic, with CPU and others alike. There's lots of small attention to detail improvements like better match commentary and PPV specific entrance commentary. The version of the characters actually matter on commentary, too - For example, if you were to play as the 02' version of Undertaker, the commentators will actually talk about him like that's the most recent version of him, and as if the streak never ended. They definitely put a lot of love in the small details in this game.I do however have some gripes with the gameplay. The choice to switch over the pin system to button mashing was a bold one, but I understand the thought process behind it - It's beginner friendly. Though I found myself unable to lose any match because I'm just that decent as mashing, and I know others who had this same problem and chose to change to the old system. Characters also recover and get up a lot faster this year, making ladder matches and tag matches an absolute hell. I like how you can spam the insta-recovery ability and pretty much nosell everything, but it can get kind of annoying in PVP matches. Speaking of, online match making is still buggy, laggy and as bland as ever, with hardly any new match types or options to use. You'll still run into just about as many gameplay glitches as you would in any other past 2K game.My main issues however rely in the actual content of the game. To me it feels like in order to bounce back from 2K20, they had to shove some new modes into 2K22 to reel in the fans they lost, even if it meant finally having to include GM mode, a mode we have been begging to return for over a decade now. After spending a couple hours in each mode it felt to me that ALL of these modes were rushed in some capacity, and it made the overall experience of the game feel very hollow and lifeless. I'll be leaving an in-depth review of each mode below.MyGMStarting with this one since it was the crown jewel of most players that planned on buying the game. I got to say, the expectations were incredibly high. With 2 whole years to work on this mode with improved technology, you'd THINK it would have all the features and depth of the GM modes in games that were made over 10 years ago - But it simply doesn't. For starters, all of the titles aren't even in the mode. Each brand gets 1 male title and 1 female title. There is no calendar, and you cant send your superstars to do other things on off days (they don't exist apparently). Every card only has 3 matches and 3 promos (to which the options are incredibly bland). You can only do 1v1 & 2v2 matches. You can't set specific storylines or hire writers. You can only sign around 10 superstars because the budget is super low.If you ask me, the time they spent adding new features like GM character select, ability cards and venue purchases should have been spent adding features that were EXPECTED to be in the mode, as they were in previous editions of the mode. Without them, this mode feels very unfinished and off-putting to play, and in my opinion It's very clear they only put this in the game to reel people back in. It's a very unbaked mode that you will be disappointed by and left wanting more. Hopefully they improve upon this foundation and turn it into a more complete mode in 2K23.MyRiseIt almost hurts to say...but this mode really reminds me of 2k15's my career...and that was REALLY bad. There's absolutely no cohesive over-arcing story like there was in 2k19 & 2k20, and most of your experience will be you fighting random matches with a couple sentences of bland backstory slapped on to give you a sense of reason to go on. There's hardly any cutscenes EVER - The first actual cutscene I saw that wasn't the intro was when I was already on RAW...And they looked more like universe mode cutscenes than anything interesting or cinematic. Remember what I said about story? Yeah, well, most of the storylines you'll play will start over corny tweets in a Twitter feed that you access through the options menu. I'm not kidding. No interesting ways to start or encounter rivalries, no voice acting, nothing. Like I said, it reminds me HEAVILY of 2k15's career mode with a Twitter feed breaking up the matches rather than Vickie Guerrero. A very disappointing step back from 2k19 & 2k20's career mode. They were both linear and had no freedom whatsoever but at least they had a story to go off of and felt like they had a direction.MyFactionThis was 2K22's dark horse. Nobody expected this mode, and it wasn't really talked about very much as a wanted concept until it was officially revealed. It's basically NBA2K's MyTeam, but in a wrestling game - You buy card packs with players to build the ultimate team and take it online to test your strength and show off your collection.Sounds cool, right? Well the experience is immediately soured right off the bat once you realize that there is no multiplayer in this mode, making you question why you should even put the time and effort into collecting anything If you can't show your collection to anybody or use your cards against other people. It makes the mode ENTIRELY aimless.The way you earn currency to buy cards with in the mode isn't very fun, either. Normal VC doesn't work in this mode, you only earn the special currency used in this mode in one of their 2 mini-modes. 3v3 matches, and 1v1 matches.The 3v3 matches are an absolute chore for reasons I've already stated. You're pretty much forced to end every tag match with a submission unless you want to sit there for an hour straight hoping to get lucky for a 3 count before someone breaks up the pin, and even then the matches can sometimes take ages, only for you to gain a small amount of currency for each one.The 1v1 matches SHOULD have been fun, but there's a very unfortunate, unnecessary catch - You can't simply win these matches your way, you have to do certain objectives before you win, or else it will be treated as a loss. You heard me. You can't even play the mode the way you want to.And with such boring, aggravating game modes, you again question why you put yourself through the torture If you can't even use your spoils you gain from it against real people. This mode can EASILY be fixed by adding an online feature to it next year, and can be made better by taking more inspiration from NBA's MyTeam.

Wait until it's had several more patches, and even then, try to get it on sale.The combat is fun and varied, but the modes and features that have true longevity in these games are broken and inaccessible. Community content is the lifeblood of these games, and the fact that most of it crashes the game really limits the experience. Can't use Create-a-Show, can't use Universe Mode, can't use custom arenas. The loading times are painful, more painful than I've ever recalled in this series. Showcase Mode is dull, and having Rey (who's never been a charismatic talker) narrate the whole thing didn't help. I'm sure I'd like MyRise, but after pouring about an hour into creating my character, the game crashed. It's a shame that I bought this through Humble and that I've spent most of my playtime on loading screens or downloading characters that I can't even properly utilize, because I would definitely refund this.

I do not say that lightly. I have written positive reviews of divisive, at times maligned products, as they managed to meet my own expectations.I have great respect for the craft of gamedev and what goes into creating these experiences. With rare exceptions for purposes of humor, I do not review flippantly. But I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, except to a highly select audience.I give Visual Concepts credit where it's due. They've inherited a series from a dev team who worked on it for decades, and during some very difficult circumstances, managed to produce a reasonably functional and stable game that does an arguably acceptable job of exploiting the series' strengths while adding some interesting twists to the formula. And they did this after taking two and a half years off following the troubled launch of WWE 2K20, to try to get it right. I commend them for that, and for creating what is a reasonably enjoyable experience when it works.The new MyGM mode, though limited compared to classic GM modes, has been a surprise standout for me. Setting it up, trying to figure out what will get the highest ratings, and managing a show budget are unexpectedly addictive.This year's Showcase, a historical career retrospective focusing on Rey Mysterio that stretches from WCW to his current stint with his son Dominik, is fun and doesn't overstay its welcome. Transitions between archival video footage and angle-perfect gameplay in that mode are a fantastic presentational touch. Along with the period-accurate visual filters and lighting used in many of those venues and broadcasts.While not a fan of combos, and most of what's on offer here is a mere reshuffling of states and actions with different inputs, the new control scheme is likely beginner-friendlier.Each of the game's modes - from the card collecting MyFaction, to MyGM's management options, to Universe Mode's full micromanagement of everything, to MyRise's branching career mode - feels distinct, self-contained, and in and of themselves fun. Unfortunately, a lack of cross-mode integration was step one in my inexorable spiral toward frustration. I spend a lot of time in these games' creation modes. I spent days carefully creating my custom CAS, which I planned to use in MyRise. Maddeningly, that's not something 2K22 permits. You cannot import a created superstar into MyRise. Nor can you export your MyRise character to other modes.Putting care and effort into a CAS is a sizable time investment. Having no way to use them in this game's career mode is simply not a user-friendly design. Recreating them entirely for MyRise is just as bad.I ended up making a cartoonish CAS I threw together in moments instead, because it simply wasn't worth the effort.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784244540I then moved onto MyFaction. I found it enjoyable. You create a deck of cards representing specific superstars, and then play them in matches to level them up and unlock additional cards. Some cards reveal otherwise inaccessible superstars, such as classic versions of characters. Except... yet again... these unlockable characters cannot be used outside of MyFaction. It's counterintuitive, and killed any sense of payoff for grinding.These odd limitations litter the game. There are no tag team or mid-card titles in MyGM Mode. Promos have been removed from Universe Mode. This year's custom entrances are far simpler affairs, with many important options gutted entirely, supposedly to avoid issues present in 2k20.And unfortunately, that brings me to my single biggest issue with this release. \"It hits different!\" That's 2K22's slogan. \"Redesigned engine.\" These are things you can read on storefronts. Yet while more stable overall, the game is packed with the same legacy issues that have plagued the series for years. And some new ones. The title screen failed to acknowledge any input for nearly 40 seconds if I downloaded too many community creations. Load times when using created superstars and arenas grew to 4 minutes. There is clipping through body parts during entrances, despite tight limits being placed on entrance creation and other measures supposedly introduced to avoid this. Hair looks and animates just as jankily and rough as ever. Many In-game superstar faces look less accurate than community creations do.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2788025464Online play is marred by lag and disconnects (which costs rewards.) There's no variable refresh rate support. Texture quality is a greyed out setting that only changes if you change your display resolution (and even then only if you have above an unknown VRAM threshold.) Altering attires for existing superstars introduces permanent geometry warping on in-game models. As in 2K20 there is a soft limit on total user created images before issues emerge. Once exceeded, images on downloaded wrestlers simply vanish. Nothing warns players of this. I worked for days on a CAS only for one eye to become permanently frozen (more wasted time, & this is an old bug.) Universe is buggy (custom arenas don't save to shows consistently, invisible wrestlers attack you, titles don't change hands as cutscenes say they have, etc.) Bugged custom belts are blank.Then there is the UI and general user experience. The editor has flashing selection highlights that cover fine details and can't be disabled. Minor accessibility features enabled by users don't work online. UI leaves some players uncertain what to do in MyRise. I could go on.The cherry on top? Losing 100+ hours of progress & creation work to a simple reinstall. Something no other Steam game has done to me.ConclusionWWE 2K22 is a game I wanted to love and I have the hours to prove it. I'll likely continue the struggle to extract enjoyment from it. But in its current state it doesn't feel like it respects my time, money, or intelligence. For every moment of fun, there is a frustrating restriction or technical flaw that makes it a grind to get the most out of. There have been some very high profile \"worst launches ever\" in recent years. Yet those games were islands of functionality and stability in comparison to this one. They got hate-trained, while actual broken annualized sports IPs get a pass year after year. Enough is enough.I've played this series for 22 years. This is now the third time a return to form has been implied in some way.

The setting tells it all. You're alone, navigating a small submarine in a blood ocean on an alien moon. You can't look out of the window, only take snapshots with your camera.There is no marker on your map so you'll have to navigate via coordinates. I actually liked this idea and the game itself isn't so long that it starts to get tedious. You'll have to take a certain number of pictures to complete your mission. An alarm is kicking off when you're getting to close to a wall - and it never stops until you're increased the space inbetween. The sense of danger, of dread and the classic fear of that what lurks in the dark and can't be seen - yet heard - makes this little game very special.

The player begins as a mind inside a bulky, mechanical body, separate from it. But by just playing, by experiencing the, and, through the body; we begin to replace our senses. Our sight becomes almost null, just a few glimpses that more often than not show us nothing but void, our touch; just a couple of lights on a radar and our limbs; the buttons on the panel. The only one that remains unchanged is our hearing, which is the most reliable, consistent and, unfortunately, the truest of them all.The coordinates and the pressing of buttons just became natural, i began to juggle with them absent-mindedly, just like walking doesn't require mental strain behind every step. But hearing... My sense of hearing never fell into my subconscient, for it warned me faster, more consistently of the threats that came to me, like one hears a possible danger before feeling it up on their leg (such as watching the radar lights flare up rapidly and turn off again in an open space in the tunnels). Just like opening our eyes in a sleep paralysis, trying to catch that final gaze into the darkness; reaching for the camera at the last node, unveils the horrific truth... already too late.Iron Lung is a perfect example on how to put the player INTO the game and truly experience terror as if it were on our own, true skin, leaving behind jumpscares that only appeal to the eyes behind the screen and only show shock and tension through mechanics."}, {"username": "spanishteacher69", "comment": "was that a dopefish reference"}], "game_id": "1846170", "game_title": "Iron_Lung"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "CorvusCorax", "comment": "Some of you have already played other software from Noble Muffins. Most notably, Thief Simulator, which was released a couple of years ago. So perhaps you can consider this game the third-person version of it.If you have not played that like myself let's continue! You play as Jack who ends up in the prison of a small town following an awful heist. As somebody wants you free you are given the key to your cell and asked to escape, get to a motel and also to get your towed car. These first couple of missions can be considered the tutorial of the game.After that you end up in Bar 66 where you meet Stacks. He'll give you a lot of missions and following his storyline is the way to complete the Prologue. Now, what are these missions? They are jobs and are all about stealing something. It can be a precious guitar or just a special whiskey some consider invaluable. You are free to explore the town in a Grand Theft Auto-like fashion meaning you can always hop in your vehicle and drive around as you see fit. The best of the game for me was the preparatory session. Each job (or robbery) requires careful planning. The game keeps feeding you with tips as more and more items or tools become available. You learn how to disguise yourself as an electrician, how to sneak, enter with the use of a hammer or crowbar and how to escape the police. You need to see a corrupt cop to get your heat lowered following a couple of busted heists. Now, just because your mission objective is one particular item it doesn't mean you can't steal other stuff. Bigger devices such as microwave ovens or TVs can also be picked up and put in the trunk of your car. Be on the lookout for parking spaces as they allow you to change your clothes and also to sleep: sleeping is essential as if there are no or fewer tenants in a house your job will be significantly easier. Jack's ability to get better at running or have a bigger backpack all can improved in the form of skills. After each heist you get an evaluation and provided that you were not noticed and that you left with a full backpack you can get a very high score which can also yield you 50% plus XP.I completed the free Prologue and did not have the chance to use any lockpick tools. Also, there are some options in your inventory menu that are inactive. In the full game we'll probably be able to purchase real estate and also new vehicles.

The first is that the rate of getting new characters is so slow (I got about one every 10 hours, 2 common and 1 uncommon), that this model quickly veers into pay to win. Playing with the basic characters is fine to start, but quickly becomes repetitive. The second issue is the lack of a player base. After playing in the arena for two days, I was already in the top 250 in the world. This led to longer and longer wait times to play anything except asychronous games. It is also sometimes frustrating with the few daily quests as some are nearly impossible when playing against other non-paying players.

That is to say, its not \"pay to win\" but more like pay to never lose. That means both lose games against opponents that have payed AND lose excess resources you have accumulated. For a \"free to play\" player it can be very annoying when you reach the resource cap, which can happen very quickly. After capping out my beans, tears and XP I find no reason to continue playing since I cant progress any further. If you have patience and restrain playing an hour everyday should be enough to make steady progress. However, the game's monetization system is very exploitative. You can quickly lose count of the money you spent and the actual \"worth\" of the fake currency and resources you are paying for. And as I mentioned in the beginning, the game is very addicting. The art-style feels like eye-candy to my eyes and the vivid colors captivates your attention. The animation played in the beginning does an amazing job at drawing your attention for the first time playing. That took me by surprise and I thought it was the start of an interesting story. However after walking you through the tutorial, the narrative didn't lead anywhere. I will continue to keep playing for a while just to see if my opinion about the game changes. For now I do Not Recommend this game for the majority of people since I find it highly likely you will unnecessarily spend money on this. An underlying problem I have with this game is that it looks suspiciously like a cash-grabbing machine. For all the love that certainly went into this game, I get the unsettling feeling that the game wont be regularly updated and properly managed. Also, I find it hard for an invested, healthy and long lasting community to be created around this game.

Charming graphics, fun gameplay loop. Overall, I recommend it. But there are issues you should be aware of before you buy. This game has some rough edges. First, I'll give you a couple tips if you're a complete noob. Firstly, this is not really an autobattler. If you don't ever control your troops at all, you'll lose a lot more often. Magic is extremely OP, get as many spells for your hero as possible. Pay attention to where your enemy's reinforcements spawn, and put long lasting AOE (area of effect) spells on that location.(spells like meteor rain, siege rain, etc). Whenever possible, use aforementioned AOE spells to disrupt your enemy's ranged units. Position your big beefy guys and melee troops in front of your ranged troops before the battle to maximize their effectiveness. If you have a fast group of units, it's always a good idea to position them away from your main army so you can flank the enemy ranged troops. Most ranged troops cannot attack at melee range or their damage is greatly reduced, so the faster you can get troops in their face the better. Last tip for battles is a tactic called \"hammer and anvil.\" Summoning spells are good for this tactic. If you summon troops behind your enemy's front line and then smash into the enemy with your own troops from the other side, the enemy will be stuck fighting in two directions and you'll have the advantage. Very effective tactic. Rough Edges:-The UI doesn't scale particularly well. The minimap gets in the way. Either it's too small to read anything on it, or it's too huge and takes up too much of the screen-Game needs a \"turn off mouse scrolling\" menu option. In battles when you're trying to move troops around from reserves or cast spells and you move your cursor down, the camera also starts scrolling down. It's incredibly irritating. It sort of works to hold W to keep the camera still while you click stuff on the bottom action bars, but it's not a great fix.-The game doesn't control super smoothly, it's clunky and too easy to misclick, and in battles the \"drip\" feature bugs out frequently when you're trying to move guys to or from reserves. -The AI cheats (as in it gets more resources than you), so you need to be aware of that if you want to win. -In larger games, waiting for AI turns gets extremely tedious if there are 3+ AIs. The game also seems to slow down a ton, so I suspect it has optimization issues despite its simple graphics. -This game is not well balanced, but I don't consider that a bad thing. It lets you do some bonkers strategies that are 2000% unfairly overpowered, but I think that adds to the game's charm."}, {"username": "dbemont", "comment": "The good:  superb gameplay, interesting strategic choices, widely varied factions and heroes and maps for endless replayability, an AI that can play the gameThe downsides:  Lots of information needed to make strategic choices is either inconvenient to find, or totally unavailable.  Some hero skills are well defined, others not at all.  And the UI has some VERY rough edgesAlso to consider:  The strategic map looks so much like Heroes of Might and Magic 3 that a lot of gamers are frustrated to find that the strategies here are quite dramatically different.  So much of this game is about very specialized hero skills.  And until you figure out the significance of the Bodyguard skill, you are going to have a tough time.

I stuck with it through it's very laggy and buggy periods and think it's in a reasonably stable and playable state right now. This game is good, very fun and worth playing. I would be writing a raving review about how good this game is if not for the new price. I feel the developer is extremely greedy to be asking this price for this quality of game. Basically yes, the game is fun, you can sink 10+ hours into it, but the gameplay gets kind of stale, and lag can decrease enjoyability. It's an interesting concept mixing some aspects of strategy and RPG, and the factions are all reasonably unique and interesting. This said, there's only 3 factions I've even played (Decaying, Enclave, and Wild) since the other factions seem boring to me.I will say that I'm extremely disappointed to see the developer increasing the cost so much. This is a very basic game and I felt like I got my money's worth at $10 CAD when I purchased during early access. However, at $20, with extra $7 for supporter pack, it really seems to be over-reaching in my mind. If you look at Terraria at $11 CAD, Stardew Valley at $15 CAD, and Vampire Survivor at $3, I just can't justify spending $20 on this.This game really uses a lot of CPU and is not optimised to run without lag on large battles. Also, the game hasn't changed much in the time I've been playing it, yet the price has doubled.

But the music.. well, you know those catchy tunes that stick in your head? It's like that but not in a good way. It's honestly annoying and if this loops in your head.. argh. Yeah, better to listen some other music while you play this.============Now gameplay-wise the game is fine - if you've played HoMM you know how it works. You pick your faction (11 choices) and pick your hero (6 choices per faction).You get a random map generated based on templates and get thrown into the game. You build your town/castle pretty much like in HoMM, though the \"techtrees\" are somewhat randomized. You buy troops for your hero and explore, fight monsters, conquer mines and level up your hero, gaining new skills based on the hero you picked.The key difference between HoMM and Hero's Hour is that the battles are real-time - the battle pauses when you cast spells, but otherwise it runs in real-time. And honestly it gets really chaotic later when the army sizes get bigger. Sometimes it's hard to tell if you're winning or not, especially since not all of the army fights at the same time. There's a limit which can be adjusted with certain skills to become smaller or larger - and this limit dictates how much \"Power\" worth of units you can field at the same time. The remaining army joins as \"Reinforcements\" when your army takes too much damage.The game is not exactly balanced. The factions themselves are not balanced, some are just better than others. But the difference between heroes is even bigger - even inside the same faction some heroes are significantly stronger than others (Every hero has their own skill tree).  But I think it's better this way, it would be honestly boring if it was perfectly balanced.============Overall, I think Hero's Hour is pretty good. It's not like amazing or anything, but if you like HoMM and have tolerance for the retro looks, then you might enjoy the game.If they upped the graphics a notch so that they actually have some detail instead of few pixels here and there, and made less retro sounding music, then the game would be significantly better in my opinion - but that's just my preference.But like this, I think the game is a little overpriced - and you might want to wait for a sale.============Summary:The Good 👍+ Scratches that HoMM itch+ Lots of factions and heroes feel different+ Good random map generatorThe Bad 👎- Too retro look- Annoying music- Too expensive"}], "game_id": "1656780", "game_title": "Heros_Hour"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "[K98] Schwatvogel", "comment": "Don´t read this banal thums up rep.

I'm not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like \"Nah, i wont like it.\". Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.Lo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game: It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to \"win\" the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. That's when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.So, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it.

You know that feeling of being completely hooked to a brand new thematic world? Elden Ring manages to do it just as you start your journey in The Lands Between. Fight your journey through dungeons and catacombs, find treasures, get to know your enemies and discover brand new areas, each containing new lore and development that can be discovered by various meanings, talking to NPCs, reading items descriptions, finding patterns that links the bosses and lords of that area to the creatures there. It's everything we always wanted in a Classic Fantasy Medieval RPG. For the first days If I could I would not have stopped playing this game by any means, I just wanted to discover more and more and unravel it's secrets, so much fun, especially when you have friends to talk about and when you realize, they are in a totally different area that you don't even got to explore yet, but the game gives you that freedom, you are allowed to do what you can in order to progress, by your own pace and your own way. The combat got much better from previous titles in the soul series, being able to jump is amazing and having your horse to battle along side you creates a feeling that the other games simply couldn't give you. The hitboxes are better, the battles are fluid ( When you don't have that FPS drop from nowhere, but I'll get there ) and I truly believe that everyone can enjoy this game, you are the one who defines the actual difficulty of the game, there's a reason people can beat this game without getting hit, and even though of course, many bosses are tough especially if you want to play a certain way, you can and will GIT GUT, take your time. After you are done with that annoying boss the adrenaline rush you will have will be worth it. The soundtrack and the world sounds are just amazing, you can hear the noises inside dungeons, the miners banging their pickaxes against the rocks, the screeches of the creatures, the mad-whispering of the anguished souls, the water flows, the birds chirping, everything feels natural and involving. Everything made so that the world feels alive and true to it's nature. As far as the lore goes, it's a Souls game, it will be cryptic but this one gives you much more to know about, it hints you about it's mysteries and what's happening in a way that feels more natural and approachable. And all the endings and ways to get there will allow you to speculate in your own way if that happened because it had to be this way or you couldn't really do anything else about it, letting a lot for your own mind to imagine and distinguish. You'll have your own theories at the end of the game, wondering what could possibly follow your decisions. What will happen to that world after that lowly tarnished changed it. The Ring was a bit broken though...Well,  not everything is as amazing as it could be, being very straightforward, some recycled bosses felt a bit underwhelming and the optimization could be much better. After the first patch things got better, and it's far from being unplayable, but the game still struggles in some areas, and that it's not dependent on hardware, rather, it's probably related to the way it was programmed. Hopefully the will keep following with the intended patches and keep improving that segment as much as they can. Conclusion All in all, it truly is an amazing game and I'm happy that it managed to keep up with our expectations, it's certainly a title that Ill keep coming back to play more in the future. It's hard nowadays for games that have an open world to not feel empty and to not make the player feel tired, they sure managed to do it in a much better way than other recent titles could, and that alone is something that I was sure looking forward to."}, {"username": "$𝟏𝟏", "comment": "TLDR:Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph. GENRE:Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' gameGAMEPLAY:Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats  (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes\" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. 'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient). In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.  STORY:The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to \"order\". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)STRENGTHS:• Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.• Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.• Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)• You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.• There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough• The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.• Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.• Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.WEAKNESSES:• PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens. • Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully \"exit\" when you quit out until a while later.• Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.• There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.• UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items• Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a \"connection error\" and the game boots you back to single player. • Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.• (Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.• So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).• 'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power. • Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):9.9/10; easy recommendElden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC.

I will say this though, the game is very VERY fun. Even though it is not accessible to new players right off the bat, the time you spend in the training mode alone is well worth it. My advice to brand new FG (fighting game) players is practice makes perfect. The discord communities are very helpful and will teach you as you play. DO NOT get discouraged if you are getting slapped around by a CPU on easy. Pick a character that you like playing and stick with them.

The gorgeous pixel-art really pops on screen and the chiptune synth soundtrack perfectly accompanies the old-school Gameboy feel. The action takes place on a mining colony. There's been an alien infestation, and it's your job as a band of mercenaries to investigate and destroy the mutant scourge!Whilst BIOTA is labelled a metroidvania, it's is more linear than you'd expect. The map is fully outlined from the start, and most biomes need to be approached in a set order. There's an elevator fast travel mechanic, allowing you to quickly return back to HQ. As a result, backtracking is, refreshingly, kept to a minimum, with repeated visits to areas only needed for story items, or if you want to find all the secrets and get that magical 100% completion. To access many of the locked biomes, pass cards or other items are required, instead of new skills. Health and weapon upgrades are sold at the various Black Markets scattered across the map. To mix things up, there's arcade style areas where you take control of a giant mech, a submarine and a space ship. The story campaign should last you 5-7 hours, and features two endings. There's an additional four characters waiting to be unlocked, along with time trial levels and a target shooting mini game. The graphics are highly customizable, with 24 colour palettes available from the off, with a further 30 to unlock while playing. There's a lot to love here; I found the ability to manually save after any cleared room a real time saver.BIOTA is a super retro package, full of content and well worth the low asking price. If you're a child of the '80s like me, you've probably already clicked the purchase button!"}, {"username": "Sosich", "comment": "A nostalgic trip down the new-age metroidvania.After completing the tutorial level, you will be brought to a base located above the underground complex. You can use this area to heal, test your skills in a training facility, acquire upgrades on the black market, and switch between characters. Everyone has the ability to jump, shoot, and cling to the wall. Wall jumping, which is required to unlock in practically every metroidvania, is available right away.The only thing that distinguishes the characters is their weapon and special ability, which are listed on their ID cards among other information like age and nationality. At first, only four squad members are available; the others are discovered as you explore the complex and after you finish the game. Despite differences in speed and power, the shooting pattern is what you should be looking at. Some have a slower gun that fires stronger bullets, while others have a quick machinegun that fires weaker bullets. It all comes down to personal preference. You'll generally stick with one hero to the end, with the exception of a portion when a certain hero is required and vehicle stages. Special ability also doesn’t matter; the game can be finished without ever using it.You can buy ammo for special weapons and permanent boosts like health in the various black markets scattered around the map. The game’s currency viridium is dropped by enemies. However, until you discover a larger container, you can only carry a limited amount of viridium. I don't think I enjoy the training facility very much because it requires a recharge after each use. I get that the viridium-filled chest at the end of a training task may make obtaining upgrades a breeze, but foes drop the valuable material at a steady rate anyway.The complex is separated into various areas, each with its own set of enemies and aesthetics. It’s also very limited in terms of exploration. There are no permanent upgrades or special powers in hidden regions of the map, save from black marketplaces, which offer every key item you will need.  This necessitates a careful exploration of the map for the larger containers, as key items cost several hundred viridium bits, which you won't be able to stash in your starting container.Saving takes place at designated locations across the complex. For rapid travel around the base, some sites may contain an elevator. There's also the option of saving the game without having to find a safe room or base. Simply locate an area free of enemies or hazards and press a button on your gamepad. Oh, and respawning at these locations won't heal you; if you saved with one health point left, you'll have to continue in the same state. If you get yourself into a jam, you can use your teleport device to return to the surface.There are no checkpoints, so you'll want to save constantly. Death arrives quickly and in a variety of forms. The traps and natural threats are the ones that hurt the most. While weak enemies only take one health point from you, bombs and laser gates instantly kill you unless you have purchased an additional health point. The most common cause of death is being knocked into one of these by an enemy bullet. When navigating between rooms, I found it particularly fascinating that you only see the room layout and no objects. After the room is fully visible, enemies and destructible things appear instantly. It's difficult to explain, but it demonstrates that the developers are well-versed in the period; it's a minor element that complements the game's overall aesthetic.The enemy variety and design are both rather good. The presence of an entity known as \"The Agent\" can be seen throughout the base, and the black mold has taken possession of all lifeforms. Bosses are essential, and this game has a few. I like how these fights prioritize platforming patterns over shooting. However, they’re quite easy once you figure out their limited attack pattern.The color palette can be changed at any time from the pause menu. There’s a bunch of them and anyone will find the favorite that will stay with you from start to finish. Each option contains 4 colors. While the left and right are only different hues of white and black (or gray), it's the center two that actually make the difference. Obviously, not all colors work together. If you have a mild form of color blindness, like me, some settings may even make the experience uncomfortable. The Orion or Neptune palettes, for example, made my eyes hurt by making the screen pulsate. Wave is similar, but the colors are more subtle, and it quickly became one of my favorites. New palette options are unlocked by collecting specimen found in plain sight or hidden behind a breakable wall. A few notes here. The freshly acquired palettes, for starters, aren't marked. It's tough to keep track of which palettes are new when there are so many. It's also a pain to switch between them; you have to go through each one separately. And second, the breakable walls have no visual clue that there’s something behind them. Shooting at every wall section in the room is not fun.Music is great, it has that nostalgic ’80 feel with its synth beats. The intro, on the other hand, could benefit from a lower volume because the bass clashes with the narrator's deep voice. No big deal because that’s the only time you’ll be hearing it. The game relies solely on subtitles, which could require a minor tweak. All words are crammed into the upper portion of the large text box that displays during cutscenes, leaving the bottom part unused and making the text difficult to read. I believe that adding more space between lines would help.Achievements encourage you to replay the game and race against the clock. There's also a shooting gallery available right away, where you have to hit targets with a sniper, who is possibly the game's most underutilized character. The sniper is stationary; all you're doing is moving the crosshair and firing at targets. One final frustration for achievement hunters is that once you've completed the game, you can't go back and look for missing items. And the achievement for collecting 15 specimens did not unlock."}], "game_id": "1640320", "game_title": "BIOTA"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "DezzyPog", "comment": "This is so close to what I loved about Demon's Souls back in 2009.

I didn't like the game for the first 30 minutes, mainly because the first area is somewhat poorly designed I feel, and the character moves like a snail without the upgrades, but if you stay with it, I think you will find a very enjoyable semi-open world game with lots of fun secrets. You can finish the Early Access in about 3 hours, but there are at least 3 optional areas that I know of, so I would say 6 to 7 hours of exploration, plus a few hard secrets that I can't solve. Don't worry about the walking speed, you can directly upgrade the movement stat at the 'save' crystal, and it does not take a ton of points. I will say the inventory and the hotkeys are not very friendly, it's hard to explain but you have to leapfrog your active items, and if you try to charge 2 spells at the same time you put your hand in a very weird position. Also, the game really needs the 'exit to the main menu' option, if there is loading before death I can't find it.The way the developer structured the exploration reminds me of Dark Souls, the optional areas will have multiple exits into other zones, so depending on your luck, you might take a completely different path, or completely miss a huge portion of the content. Also, make sure you hug the walls until you see (?) signs, there are a ton of shortcuts and secrets. Surprisingly the best part of the game is the atmosphere, not so much early on, but when you get into the meat of the game it really feels like going through the 10 layers of hell, exploring seemingly endless corridors, and claustrophobic tunnels. There is a pretty big variety of weapons, spells, and active items, I was actually really enjoying the challenge at first, but the balancing does fall apart as most enemies can't contest with ranged weapons. Honestly, if you want the game to be more interesting, don't use the bows or magic weapons, it ruined the game for me - perhaps you should add some arrows or bolts like 20/20, there is no the incentive to use melee weapons and get debuffed, outside of immunes.  Pros: + The 'open-world' does not hold your hand, there is a lot of optional content if you can find it, and you are not forced to do it. You can sort of find your own way to the end. You can go back and explore for various secrets, there are some really sneaky areas you can come across.+ Pretty decent variety of weapons and magic, for an indie game anyway. It kinda sucks that melee weapons get overshadowed by just spamming ranged weapons, I think it removed the suspense from the exploration, but it was still fun to whale on enemies.+ I won't say the world-building is like top-tier, but it's better than most retro-inspired games, the characters are pretty neat, even if you don't get a ton of interactions. Feedback:  Hub  - I didn't get much use out of the alchemy, I find the effort I put into finding the combinations is not worth the time, maybe provide more help for the player. The enchantments are kinda weird, even after finishing the game I am not sure why some of them work and others do not, maybe a little help there as well. The stores run out of items? Starting Area  - I would recommend buffing the initial character speed to 4.8 and increasing the mouse sensitivity base and range, it's very slow, and maybe help the player find the key to the door. (wtf is it in the s___, who would ever expect it to be there), I didn't even have a coin. I think that 'no attack' curse should really go, it's just annoying more than anything.  Ranged Weapons  - I feel like having infinite arrows or magic weapons is too strong. Not sure if adding ammo would make the game more 'fun', but I don't know, maybe you would rather add more immunes perhaps, make skeletons take 10% of arrow damage so you still have to smack someone. UI  - needs an option to leave into the main menu or load without dying.  Overall Thoughts on EA 3/16/22 It's a bit funky at first, just stay with it, it gets much better, and then it kinda falls apart when the enemies fail to keep up. Right now the exploration is very fun, but obviously, I would still like more, and I think you can go even harder on the secrets, there were some areas I wish had more going for them. Overall, for an indie game, if you don't mind a slightly clunky UI, the game has a lot going for it.For more niche, obscure and underrated games: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/"}, {"username": "Asael", "comment": "It's is quite a rarity that I come across a game I thoroughly enjoy let alone a dungeon crawler. Most never seem to get it quite right for me, but Lunacid fills that niche perfectly. If you enjoyed FromSoftware's progenitors to the Soul series, à la King's Field, Lunacid will definitely scratch that itch while adding its own sense of uniqueness. Trust me when I say games like this not only fall into a very niche genre, but are just absurdly rare to ever be made to begin with. I've spent YEARS sifting through games trying to find something like this only to come out with nothing. I highly recommend it if you have a soft spot for the OG dungeon crawlers.A little on what to expect and a tad of advice: -Time wise, depending on what you want out of the game, you can expect to complete what is available for the early access in around 10 hours or so. But if you're anything like me, and you take the time to find all the secret doors, hidden quests, spells, weapons, etc you'll finish in around 60 hours. It all depends on what you want to make of the game.-Like its inspiration, Lunacid does not hold your hand at all. Even the Soul series gave more direction on what you need to do and where to go. You don't really have that at all here. It's all left up to you, your persistence, your ability to be curious, and your sense for paying attention to detail.-Starting off, one of the common complaints is the agonizingly slow movement speed. This is probably one of the most common complaints across all dungeon crawlers of this nature. Again, this is where you need some of that persistence to bear with it for a few hours as you get exp and gain some levels. If you are one of these people who have a hard time stomaching the starting sluggishness I recommend allocating your first stat points into SPD (speed) as this will help alleviate the grueling slog in movement.-Take your time. This game is a journey to be experienced not a b-line bum rush to some final destination (and given this is early access there technically isn't one at the time of writing this). The real enjoyment is the discoveries you make. If you get an excitement rush when you discover some secret room, solve the mystery in that room, and you just want to run and tell people; that's when you've got it right. With all of that being said, I'd give the game a 9/10 given what is all here at the time of writing this review. Looking forward to what is in store for the game beyond the early access. Very well done to the developer."}, {"username": "Cthulhu135", "comment": "So I haven't played too much of this yet, but the bit I have played I already adore.The gameplay is simple (so far) yet satisfying, the graphics are wonderfully nostalgic, the art direction is great, the characters I've met are charming, and the music is... *chef's kiss*My only complaints as of right now are in the settings: The PSX filter makes text (especially in menus) a little too hard to read, and I feel as if the gamma slider needs tuning if that's a thing because as of right now it feels like it's either slightly too dark or slightly too bright no matter what I do (though admittedly that could be my monitor)But in closing, this has been in early access for less than a day and it's already phenomenal. Great job as always, KIRA!"}, {"username": "slurpcore enthusiast", "comment": "Minor Update to the review - extra bug/feedback mention at the end!Lunacid is a dark-fantasy RPG/Dungeon Crawler, heavily inspired by FromSofts Kings Field and Shadow Tower/Abyss - the grandfathers of Soulsborne as we know it, these are the games FromSoft found their initial userbase, eventually splitting off into Armored Core until 2009 when Demon Souls arrived quickly followed by Dark Souls 1 which took the world by storm and you can feel its effects to this day in multiple indie, AA and AAA games.Lunacid has a lot of history to draw from and so far even though treading familiar ground it feels very unique, from the UI elements, locations, the setting, everything feels that it belongs here in Lunacid, not from some other IP/game, but purely Lunacid. The gameplay is simple, deep and exhilarating. It's played from a First Person perspective, features mouselook/aim and full controller support if that's what you prefer. You start the game with nothing, no gear spells, guides (save for the manual on how to play.) it's up to you to find your way out of the hole the protagonist begins in which - for a game inspired by King's Field I was genuinely shocked/surprised to see a class selector and a very basic but still neat, character creator - once the intro cutscene's over you now find yourself deep an abyss with no obvious way out, walking onwards you get your first weapon, upon equipping it you can now truly begin the game, slaying basic enemies to level up so you can take more damage or even cast spells, two of which are found nearby, combat's basic you can either rapidly tap left-mouse button for quick but weak attacks, or hold it down to charge up an attack and do more damage, enemies have weakspots - mostly the head so there's some skill involved alongside avoiding hits because early on it's pretty easy to die and if you haven't saved... That's lost progress.The game's atmosphere and tone is perfect, it starts off like any old adventure, there's a bit of eeriness to it, but then you get further, you open up an Enchanted Door and suddenly the music goes quiet, the screen gets darker before eventually the mood changes the game becomes dark and moody, I was genuinely put on the edge of my seat for this entire segment, there's no enemies just the cold dead air and haunting background track, each zone features multiple tracks that all fit and belong and each track is incredibly addictive to listen to, I sat in the Library and Hub just relaxing to the music that played in each zone, eventually I started to hum both tunes in the back of my mind which shocked me for an Indie 'Souls-like.'  Further on you now have multiple zones to take on, you can go deeper and explore the sewers and see where that takes you, or head around to the side under and up to find yourself at a mystical underground forest, or even increase your jump height to find yourself into an originally unaccessible location which leads to a mountainous Library, filled with the most interesting enemies in the game - personally speaking. So far, the Early Access build for Lunacid has been an incredibly positive one, I'm excited to see where the game goes next - of course due to its Early Access nature there's faults/gripes/nitpicks and things to offer feedback on and I want to end the review on what I have issues with, stuff that could be done and maybe more.Firstly: the platforming, it's neat that there's basic/simplistic platforming in this game, it's easy to do just space, you can increase your jump height with one of the stats, that's neat! What isn't is how easy it is to get stuck within the environment the broken staircase that leads to the Library had me stumped multiple times, and the only way to get out was to fully quit the game (I'll bring this back up shortly.) This happened multiple times because the slop would awkwardly stop your momentum, outright stop you, or even cause you to jitter and slide back down, it's awkward and annoying, this happens within the forest area as well but to a lesser-degree (thankfully) I was stuckwithin a tree branch on ground level because I was knocked to the side by one of the enemies and once again, I couldn't move so I had to restart the game just to leave which meant I had to go back a couple of minutes because I hadn't saved.Secondly: the menu, what's there is great, its easy to use, understand and follow, I don't exactly have gripes or nitpicks for it, but what I think is needed is rebinding support and the option to reload a save or even go back to the main menu, your only option in game is to outright quit the game to your desktop, also the lack of a pause is... odd. I get that Demon Souls and Dark Souls do this, but those are hybrid games with online support and are largely built around those systems, whilst King's FIeld wasn't, having zero pause in a game that has no online systems is jarring, especially for one heavily inspired by FromSofts original games/saga.  Thirdly: The Shulkers located within the first area/zone have a ranged attack that can clip through rocks, whilst it's easy to dodge with default stats (Witch and Royal class.) It'd still be nice to be able to use the few bits of rocks to outright avoid them.Lastly: This ain't even a gripe, nitpick or anything I just want to say you're doing absolutely amazing work so far, and God, please give me more. Lunacid kept me hooked for 6 hours until I maybe? Finished the Early Access build in one sitting, it's absolutely worth the current asking price, and likely even the 1.0 price - it's cheap, fun and an excellent time."}], "game_id": "1745510", "game_title": "Lunacid"}, {"reviews": [{"username": "KaJe", "comment": "I hope that this review isn't discouraging to the developers. And that in time, I can come back and make this my main aim-trainer! I think the concept is there, but it needs work. It's early access and released this year, so it's all right. It's not filled with many bugs so I'll let it slide, but \"early access\" is becoming a bad excuse in most game releases these days.I think for right now, I can't really recommend this product just yet. But I do see in the future if changes happen. I will keep a close eye on this trainer!Pros: Fair pricing (AimBeast's recent price increase was stupid) $10 is perfect pricing, and no paid DLCs Replay viewer is one of my favorite features, and I wish other aim trainers implemented it. UI designer is clean and modern The statistics and graphs are awesome! But I could see it overwhelming for beginners! Have a simplistic and advanced view, or grouping it maybe in the future? Good amount of options in there. Not too complicated for a beginner; advanced for the more experienced.  Sensitivity Randomizer More technical terms like cm / 360 Seems to listen to their community Nice tutorial in the beginning, so you aren't completely lost Custom scenarios, easy to make.Cons:The priority of \"perfect sensitivity\" makes it hard for me to recommend. Though I understand it's per game, with having added a sensitivity randomizer. It's under the concept that you don't need to stick to one sensitivity over all your games. That different sensitivities suit better specific games/game types. WHICH IS GOOD, but I could find those ranges in a Google Doc by other aim communities in 2 minutes, then needing to run 10 minutes of scenarios. (Cool concept though. I guess for non-experienced aim trainer users, it's great!) Some other stuff isn't intuitive, like local to find your scenarios, while the online tab only shows routines.  FOV type / Game terms are their technical versions, and most people who aren't from AimBeast or Kovaaks will understand. (HDeg & VDeg) Scrolling through the playlist and scenarios list, it randomly goes back up. And I know it's not my mouse and a dirty scroll wheel encoder. No clock UI setting. Some aim communities use a clock for their community ranks systems to ensure no cheating happens. Those with one monitor (I have two) need to tab to check the time. Just allow a toggle, then we are good! Closest Mouse Path seems based on your last target kill. Not your current mouse position. I don't know how it would affect game performance to have it run calculations constantly. So I'll let it slide. Most people will have this off, as you usually look ahead to your next target for static scenarios. You also go for clusters instead of closest for higher scores so... Why have a tips section when it's just listed as \"Coming soon\"? AimBeast has \"Arena\" and \"Routine\" sections for an entire year as \"Coming Soon\" and still waiting for the \"Arena\" The \"Sensitivity\" overlay for in-game, only shows Oblivity sensitivity. Most people will be in a specific game profile and not \"Oblivity\" as their sensitivity profile. Either show whatever game profile you are in, or cm / 360. Or get used to having people have it disabled. The game likes to randomly stutter for me while running scenarios, which is annoying. I don't mind if the game lags when doing score calculations like in Kovaaks or AimLab, but in actual scenario runs, it is painful. Most people don't play aim trainers for the trainer. They are used more like a warm-up, but it still discourages me from using the trainer. People for leaderboards, scores, and competitions will look at other competitors. More games in the \"converter\" tab would be something for the future. Other aim trainers like Kovaaks and AimBeast don't list many games. But you are also competing with AimLab's list, which is free. Being able to input cm / 360 directly would also be nice :D While the UI is modern and clean, it's overwhelming for beginners. It's what drives people away from Kovaaks and AimLab at times. The AimLab scenarios (Sixshot, Gridshot, etc) are just a personal gripe of mine. But I've come to hate it, and felt low effort, lazy, and do the opposite of making your aim better.

If they actually paid attention to how the algorithm works, they'd notice theres several different option, varying from it to find your sensitivity within 1 day or whatever extended period of time. Also for the people saying it's giving them too high of a sensitivity simply haven't explored the trainer enough. There's legit an option for a base sensitivity. Overall I'd give an 7.5/10, yes it's good but its nowhere near perfect. Give it a year or so and I'm sure it'll be 100% worth the $10 though.tldr; 10/10 kekw"}, {"username": "Sethooo", "comment": "Pretty cool I like it better than Aim Lab"}, {"username": "Pedestrian_King", "comment": "Considering recoil is also a major factor affecting aiming, the current stage of Oblivity does not take it into account is a bit disappointing; however, the app still gives somewhat an unbiased and comprehensive analyze towards players' performance.

At this point in time the game is NOT worth 10$...It is not finished. The UI is a mess, filled with info that is very unrelated to what you are doing. The sensitivity finder - which is the whole selling point - is very very messy. I input my current sens and lets say its 1 for this example. It will put a range that is super high like 5x higher than what you play. And then you play scenarios that you cannot even aim at because you move your mouse half and inch and you do a 360... Look if all you need is a sense finder, just play some free aim trainer and try out different sens and look at your stats, that way you can control by how much you are going up or down the scale. Because this is making me worse at aiming rather than better... You forget your muscle memory when it jumps you 5x higher than your usual sens...Overall i do not recommend at this point in time. The dev team seems super chill and nice but the game is just not ready and not worth 10$ in my opinion. It has very very very few scenarios which is understandable since its new but they should have waited longer or hired more people to have a bigger library. NEGATIVES:  - Settings page is very confusing - Landing page is a mess - Sens finder is a big miss atleast in my case - Very choppy on some scenarios with fps dropping randomly - The fact that you have to convert to their sens is a bit annoying as well. Just let me select a game and show me that sens so i can understand how much up and down you taking my sens... I dont know what 299 or 310 really is....POSITIVES: - Built in sens converter is nice. - Loads fast - Small download - Nice devs"}, {"username": "Calick", "comment": "In my personal opinion, Oblivity isn't ready yet. From the poor, emotionless UI to the laggy frame drops and freezes. The boring text, and the spelling mistakes within them.However, the reason I'm not refunding and still plan on using Oblivity is because when you look at the positive sides of things, it's a pretty good product. Oblivity is the perfect tool to help you learn your perfect sensitivity, only an hour after game-play I genuinely feel like my precision in Valorant has increased significantly because of Oblivity, and I'm excited to see the updates and changes that will improve our experience playing Oblivity.A list of thoughts / bugs I noticed:- The UI could have more visual and auditory feedback.- Music- Text has basic font- Text too small at times- Too much text on screen at times- Text overlaps other text at times (specifically when selecting a training mode)- Frame drops when loading/resetting training mode- Sometimes not clear how to go back to the previous page- Video that plays cuts off near the end before finishing the videoI'm going to recommend this game because I do believe it can be one of the best aim trainers out there.Well done Poly Games! :D"}, {"username": "Handi", "comment": "Oblivity is totaly not ready yet... looks like they spent more time making tiktoks than actualy perfecting the software... btw aimlabs is free and looks way better.

Business is as usual; a few packed orders, some lone customers to make chit chat with and the occasional oddballs. Yet she can’t help but feel even more spied on by one same patron every day making an appearance here and there… Inching closer by the weeks~[+] PROS;:)  THANK YOU, NEXT~Let it be made known that yes, this latest title by Chilla’s Art (CA) is by far the closest to their trademark hit  The Convenience Store. For instance, the manning of a store- or should I say wo-manning? Miscellaneous tasks, journey to the workplace and the panic-inducing orchestration of some scares. They even share the same initials “TCS” for god sake. Coincidence, I think not!The biggest and newest feature is actually the barista simulation of packing pastries, brewing beverages according to their recipes- which you can then make your own at home? SWEET! Luckily customers are very patient and polite, to your face that is, having witnessed you go in and out the staff room to refer to your cheat sheet. There were some choices, not a first for the franchise; but to be worked in the dialogue and belonging quite well was a treat!Took me nearly three hours before resigning, with- I think and please don’t quote me on this- just a single ending? But those with past Starbucks and or other coffee establishment experience may finish it in two hours tops~TIPS:1) The orders are the same, so you can prepare them in advance should you have to restart a day!2) Can’t get the order right? It’s actually all in “the order”.3) Drink or pastry ready-to-go? Just slap the order sticker from anywhere!:)  KEEP CHILLED WHILE CHILLING AT WORK!A CA game where I didn’t want to constantly piss my pants? Instead, I get a lounge and jazz ensemble like I was also a carefree patron of the café!? But alas- or should I say thank goodness for there are two sides to the business. With the other stabbing fright and looming paranoia set in after hours so it’s a hefty balance! The café interior classes things up, kicks butt and now I really want to be a coffee freak, freeloader of wi-fi person. Patrons-wise, there are some model-quality, super kawaii acts but overall, I dig the diverse faces in the crowd. Until you realize that also means more to go through in the event of having to pick one from a line-up~:)  SHIFT. HAPPENS. I’m sure it’s fairly obvious by now that I have difficulty talking about The Closing Shift without constantly referencing The Convenience Store… But I’ll try anyway; a tragic, “unrequited” love story and one of growing obsession. It utterly milks this plot line for everything it’s got, tosses in a café to entertain and totally NOT to distract you from what happens when your attention is directed elsewhere in pleasing customers.But yes, if I had to bring in an analogy- it is P2 (2007) coming in for the kill on The Convenience Store (2020). Can’t believe it’s only been about two years for the latter…! Good times!! While there isn’t much in the characterization of the protagonist, we can still infer as to why she’s working there. And it is certainly not to be targeted. The only thing that remains a mystery is the perpetrator’s motives~:)  JACK THE BEAN-STALKER…The horror isn’t as underlying or immaterial as The Convenience Store where every shopper had that air of death or at least having faced it. Here, there is a face attached and at times, multiple ones… But only because over time of memorizing recipes and having your back turned- you sort of “forget” how they look. It doesn’t help that there are patrons who also hit on you and demand your number! Or catching mere fragments of the customers talking aloud about being leered at while on a bus journey.The answer is blatantly palpable until it physically hurts. And it shifts into a matter of waiting for them to act! The wait is insufferable, and meanwhile you jump at every noise near your apartment complex. You focus on the patrons, more than is deemed healthy! I tell you, as someone who’s worked in a café before and never worried about it, because thankfully it didn’t open too late. Now it will be all that’s on my mind so thanks a lot CA for ruining yet another profession. I’m kidding… sort of, as it’s more to raise awareness on the issue~https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783656527[-] CONS;:(  JUST DOESN’T REGISTER?The whipping up of beverage portion is wholesome and fun to get into. But there were some glaring gameplay issues with it. For instance, inserting an empty blender jug will have it perform its grind animation even with nothing in it. Some workstations, like when drinks are on the coffee dispenser- they cannot be used for mixing ingredients and instead have to be relocated to another place mat. It sounds very petty and I realize it as I’m typing but it’s enough to make anyone snap~:(  A SLOPPY EMPLOYEE…The huge difference between this and previous titles is its predictability, which is even more visible than usual! For one thing, if you played The Convenience Store- you’ll see a lot of similarities already which do ruin things in terms of expectations. And another it’s turned into more of a series of slasher tropes which would be fine in games like those by Puppet Combo~:( TOO MUCH INGREDIENTS!The story and direction are not exempted from this! In that they stray from the reputable formula of oozing paranormal behind the everyday occurrences… But here, not once did I think it had any other explanation apart from the obvious and mortal danger~BUGS:x Cars have no drivers!x Can go into/crash into/hitch a ride in cars.x Car asset missing and then suddenly reappearing. Could be intentional?x One customer stuck in the same looped animation and as conversation wasn’t even done. No order ticket was produced.x Some models had bizarrely fast walking speeds and appeared stiff-jointed!x Drinks can be stacked together at the collection area.x TV footage apparently don’t change until you “look closer”.NITPICKS:~ Cannot simply return to main menu without having to quit first.~ Can put back some items and not others.~ Beverage making is hard enough with the cups being empty. At least have the labels for what’s already in them! Besides the inventory…~ Cups to be disposed don’t correlate to orders prior to start of shift.~ Tutorial tapes play on a very small screen and is in Japanese regardless of language chosen.~ One dialogue choice left untranslated.\"- THIS IS THE LAST STRAW…!\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783657446Last Words?Latest CA entry is a misnomer in the franchise. Been done in The Convenience Store only now with more drinks… With a threat that’s always known. Still strange but I do fret as to what’s next~ If you like The Convenience Store and are finding a reason to NOT work late nights. If you love The Convenience Store but want a less scary, more chill version. Even as the series’ black sheep- it still offers a great deal.

Making the drinks is surprisingly entertaining although that's not what makes The Closing Shift so great.The ordinariness of the situation - a girl working the closing shift at a coffee shop - grounds the story in reality and makes for a truly eerie experience. The game plays on very real fears (the dark, stalkers, and being alone to name a few) to create an uneasy atmosphere, building up the horror rather than simply relying on cheap jumpscares.Graphics and Atmosphere: 4/5The graphics are excellent and the game has a striking 90s/VHS aesthetic which complements the tone of the game well. The Closing Shift's atmosphere is dark and moody although doesn't shy away from moments of comedy, which I found to be a welcome inclusion in the narrative.The character models and, particularly the walking, animations are janky but I find it adds to the unsettling vibe of the game rather than detracts from it. There's something uncanny about that way the customers look at you, which reflects well the unease of having people's gaze on you knowing they could be your stalker.Performance: 4/5The game runs smoothly and I only encountered one bug whereby a piece of the environment didn't appear properly (although this was fixed with a quick restart).Recommendation: Definitely worth full price!"}, {"username": "LizardKuwīfu", "comment": "I had been looking forward to this game for a pretty long time, and wow, I think this honestly might be one of my favourite if not my favourite Chilla's Art game.

High level review is it's not as satisfying as other games similiar like Slay the Spire or Inscyption, but it's so close to being.I'm running into a scenario where I know what the best play style is and am punished for not following it. Stealth on getting damaged is super powerful, the item that gives 2 of each item when picked up is uber powerful, divine staf (2x status on attack) is omega powerful, the item invisibility cloak (no getting attacked with no armor) is jiga powerful. RNG, RNG, RNG, basically anything that triggers faster is IMBA , like ON DEFENCE > ON HIT > ON ROUND START.I tried making playstyles that are more fun and customized but the game doesn't let you. A majority of my runs end in RNG death, the rest die in level 1/2/3 because you MUST priortize not attacking and avoiding combat at all. I want to see these improvements before I'd say this game is ready to play:- When you unlock more items, you should have ways to get more item choice otherwise item bloat means death by probability- More rewards for attacking (better loot/chance for items?), otherwise why attack- More balancing for boring items or way to upgrade items that are boring - Better loadout choices instead of just choosing 1 of 3 spells flavours.The above will reduce RNG grinding 100% and make it more replayable and customizable like slay the spire."}, {"username": "Arion", "comment": "FORWARD: Escape the Fold is a casual-ish roguelike card game that is truly as simple as it gets, without compromising on either strategy or depth. Similar to other roguelikes, you'll get to choose the path you take, suffer the consequences or reap the rewards of your decision, and eventually make your way to the final boss at the end. The game provides plenty of cards that you can also collect with many more to unlock as you play. Your starter character, a knight, is a solid first pick but eventually, you'll get to unlock new characters with new special powers.Each section of a run takes less than 5 minutes to clear, unless you take a much longer time making a decision, and a complete run takes around less than an hour... at least that's the case for me.--------------Watch me play!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pKPZq9dm2MNote that once I get that anti-Blindness card and the card that granted me Stealth if my health is an even number, it's just smooth sailing from there ;)--------------Despite finding it rather easy to play, I quite enjoyed the experience and I love the art. The game is perfectly designed as a short and chill roguelike that you can play to wind down after a tiring day. There are plenty of stuff to unlock (as well as achievements and cards to collect) so in terms of progression, there's something to keep you wanting to play more. However, I do agree with another reviewer that this game seems to be perfect for the mobile platform too. If it's available on my phone, I'll likely play a run or two before bed. Perhaps this is something that's in the works? ;)OverallI love playing FORWARD: Escape the Fold and I can definitely give it my full recommendation. It's just a fun and simple little roguelike that you can easily hop into. There are plenty of builds that you can play around with throughout your runs and there are also plenty of new cards that you can unlock as you progress. It would work well as a great intro for players who are new to the genre too.

You're using an Apple ][ e.  You're playing slowly through an absolute epic story with an RPG rule-set that is still the stuff of legend with map and storybook in hand.   A heaven to those of us who remember such times.  These Gold Box classics are not only an excellent relic of a flavor of Dungeons and Dragons long past, their style and presentation is still being emulated to this day.  If you've messed with old Bard's Tale or Wasteland, you'll recognize this as what they were riffing off over at Interplay before they got a hold of the later games, but these are so much deeper.The update adds a map and a character monitor which make the game so much more playable without really intruding.  They come with all of the original documentation including the cluebooks in pdf form.  They have the combat just perfect paced so that it doesn't take forever like it used to but doesn't feel tuned wrong like a lot of dos-box based ports.  You'll be surprised how comparable it is to the games you're playing now in many regards.A warning to noobs though: these games are unforgivably difficult in the same way most games of their era are.  The curve may be harsh for those unfamiliar with the old AD&D rules.  They were intended for grown up Dungeons and Dragons freaks who get serious and there is no difficulty adjustment.

In the life-changing milestones of our lives, this was one of the most prominent.WARNING: It's definitely, unabashedly old school. It's clunky, it's unforgiving, and it used all media types to play, from game to paperback journal entries to language-deciphering codewheel.Luckily though, this version comes with a built-in Companion module to simplify the playing experience and provide quality of life improvements like automap feature with ability to label areas, ability to change the font (since a lot of us original players are much older now and our eyes don't work so well), all documentation just a click away.Even some built-in, toggle-able \"cheats\" such as automatically ID'ing magical items, ability to heal damage and status effects while camping, auto ammo replentishing, and spell memorization.The series is absolutely huge, with lots of areas to explore, turn-based strategical combat, good story depth if you follow along with the journal entries, and since you get 8 full games for $10 its price vs content value is exceptional.Still, it's old-school to the max. It's slow-paced and requires a lot of saving, even to the point where you'll probably save before every door, 'cause you just don't know what's on the other side that will totally wreck your party, or accidentally buy something expensive just to find out the character can't use it, and even the death of a party member can quickly drain your resources.If you can endure, you will smile and you will rage, but you will feel that you were the hero of an epic adventure."}, {"username": "rrdy68", "comment": "My original thoughts on this version was wrong.  The companion app on this one does not have everything that the free download app has but you dont have to load the companion app separately every time and you can transfer characters between games.  After playing a little more of this version verses gog I believe this version is better because to the reasons listed above. For those of you having trouble with making characters use the number 1 key for down and the number 7 key for up on the number pad to scroll up and down your choices.  When you modify your characters scroll down the stats and use the left and right arrow keys to increase or decrease the number. You may also increase your new characters starting hit points in the same way. In combat you can use the arrow keys or the number keys to move as is listed in the control section of the rules.

Which by the by, popped up out of the… red(?) after you crashed your car. Someone was just here too, very recently and so you head to where all signs point to refuge! Little did you know, the twisted game was already afoot and you’re the main character in it~[+] PROS;:)  THERE COIN BE MIRACLES; WHEN YOU BLEED~Gameplay can be said to categorize into two types. First, is the free-roaming, give-chase and key simulator in the physical arcade. Second would be the JANITOR cleaning up, paradoxical game realm. While they initially constitute separate entities, they unhurriedly become interspersed with one another until the lines are blurred. The former has you search a run-down arcade foraging every nook and cranny for tokens which you then have to find and insert unto JANITOR… The latter is where the fun really gets innovative; starting out as an inconsequential time killer before becoming a key, obstacle and bridge between the physical-digital worlds. Each able to hold their own, as well as complement the other… For instance, the ability to cower in 3D by hiding from a glitchy, furious being under wherever there is space and then having to do that while sneakily playing it on-and-off!First playthrough will last bout 2-3 hours, but strictly depends on how skilled at stealth and how fearless you are. With various mystery achievements left locked, it’s safe to assume that will stretch up to 5 or more hours! Shockingly, this was one of those rarities where I COULDN’T for the life of me, get the bad ending~TIPS:1) Once you get new items, retrace your steps- you’d be amazed by what you can find!2) When the bad feels strike, just hide out till it’s alright.:)  PRESENTATION SO FATAL. I NEED A HEMO-STAT!!! What else is there to say when it’s of a low-poly look, right? Oh, I don’t know… how about the eye-popping graveyard of arcade classics!? Its true-to-life layout of the once surely ecstatic interiors, now in heartbreaking fashion devoid of children’s laughter and teens trash-talking. Its blurry textures actually add believable years to its character of being an old game. The monster(?) design is one giant, menacing grimace. Whose distorting, noisy filters and bleeding of blinding redness give it that obvious warning and elusiveness. The sound design is comparably daunting with a false quietness besides the ambiance of a dying attraction… But then you pick up on a chipper Super Mario-esque, 8-bit melody that is almost a verbal invitation. Growing on you to the point where you don’t want a peep of that vile sound anymore but it repeatedly surfaces at the unlikeliest times~:)  WHEN EVIL SPILLS OVER. There’s an unashamedly childish yet charismatic plotline attributable to Scooby Doo and The Cyber Chase (2001). Except with darker tinges and there’s no gang, just yourself! Blend that together with a The Evil Dead (2013) foolishness mix and Oculus’ (2013) cynicism acting as a straw. Finally, you get “Janitor Bleeds” and what would certainly make for a killer name of a chilling beverage!The story in and of itself isn’t revolutionary to say the least but rather how it gets told or what doesn’t is… With an opportune leaving out of details save for the cliffs notes of events leading to the present- you have got to try and fill in the rest. I confess, I was still pretty much flustered by the time the credits rolled but somehow, I’m at peace and just so downright relieved that everything was over~ :)  GET READY TO KICK THE BUCKET…If the game isn’t one ghastly metaphor or better yet, testament to how video games contribute to short attention span or the development of addictions. Then I don’t know what is! Come on, you’re so focused on figuring out the mechanics to the machine and how to have squeaky clean floors. That you may have overlooked IRL a discreet shadow, objects being knocked over, their contents spilling out all over… much like your brain probably at this very moment!Back to the unsung story bit, I dug that the machine was centered on the arcade janitor who probably sees and hears things others don’t. All while maintaining a low profile until the need to call for one arises. I’m probably reading too much in it. Like the kids, which speaking of- where’d they all go? Could they have anything to do with the teddy bears cluttered around…? I thought its reaching into and literally killing the wonderful memories we had of arcades was cruel but poignant.The origins of the machine remain unknown, but we’re not invested on that as we do the mechanisms of it. Why it’s able to be omnipresent but yet we never see it exist in two places at any given instance! Or how it is capable of doing what it does in traversing different planes. Maybe it does things that we aren’t even entirely aware of!? For example, when does the real world end and the game world begin?

Or at least found ways around minimizing the processor taking a toll! There could be more loading screens to segment the areas better. Capping the framerates, even opening up the graphic settings for a more customized touch. If anyone is wondering why this didn’t bother me enough to warrant some points docking- it’s because the gameplay was frankly THAT good and it kept my motion sickness at bay~BUGS:x Entity AI glitches out and forever attempts to chase you through the vent.x During which the chase music also never ends, even when I’ve retreated unto safety. Persists until I voluntarily died or quit the game…x First entity showdown is scoffingly a piece of cake.x Some objects could be stood on top of!x Entity’s red lights seep through closed walls.x In the final area, you could peer underneath the map when you prone.x The final machine before the ending glitched out? Could interact and hear sound effects but JANITOR doesn’t actually move.NITPICKS:~ Aiming for the weapons is off and lacking visual effects. In my opinion!~ Could be a bug or intentional prissiness, but walking away from JANITOR machine will cause all deposited tokens to be reset. Which no real-life machine would ever do!~ “Space” key could’ve been utilized to stand back up instead of fiddling with the “ctrl” to do both functions.~ Option to have multiple saves instead of just the one.\"-I’M JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

I didn't expect much out of the game, but to my surprise it was pretty good and gave some good spooks at times. Only thing that really still bothers me why is the starting of the game so damn dark (around the first 4 minutes), you can't see anything.Game takes around 2 hours to complete."}, {"username": "(YouTube)Dragnix", "comment": "Target Audience:   Very Dedicated Horror Fans that pick it up for the right sale price   Summary:  Janitor Bleeds is a game that follows a formula that has been established in the Indie Horror genre, and almost sticks it to a fault. To the point where it's hard to even recommend considering the price tag versus all the other horror games out there. It has moments where you can see some flashes of a better game, especially with some of the more subtle scares in the game. But it also has moments that really backfire on it, like anytime the game's AI attempts to do pathfinding, and finds itself stuck against a wall. Or some of the inconsistent rule sets that end up getting you killed, mostly due to the lack of detail that is present with some of the kills. It lacks a real staying factor when it comes to the presentation in the more heated moments, as your character just falling over when dying just feels very lackluster.It's also the fact that in the modern landscape, you expect a certain level of lore and detail behind the story, and maybe my expectation wasn't set right. I found the information in the story to not really be that interesting in the big picture, and didn't make me want to see more of the universe or anything along that line. Sure, the universe is put together alright from an asset and level design perspective for the level of detail here, but it felt very much a paint by numbers type of horror game: making it get lost in the sea of games that are out there.Look, if there was a middle thumb option, this game would get it. It's very much a game only to get for the right price, and if you're addicted to the indie game horror scene as a whole. Because there's much better games for the price out there. Which is why I end up giving it the thumbs down in the end, but again, it's really dependent on the type of player you are. Review Video:  https://youtu.be/NNXd9-nqGoc Lists: Positives: Small moments of subtle scares that can get under your skin smartly. The incorporation of the arcade elements does do a good job of adding to the overall game. Use of assets and assembly into level design done reasonably.  Hints of a better game under the surface, maybe gets better with alternate/other endings possibly. Negative: Inconsistent rule set that ends up frustrating a lot more then it should. AI Pathfinding is lacking. Lacks punch in the bigger moments of presentation.  Nothing unique that makes it stand out from the crowd.  Lack of drive in seeing more of the story: not interesting enough/information packed enough to really earn your attention.

The progression feels very natural with only a few minor hiccups happening in my playthrough (mostly due to my own stupidity). The team was very responsive to feedback and any questions you might have in their discord if that is something that interests you, and they seem genuinely passionate about this project. It shows! There is a lot buried in the corners of this game and multiple endings in a game as short as this one means that I will be revisiting it at some point to find the rest of those collectibles and see if I can turn the tides for the main character in a subsequent playthrough.Also, as is customary, I am a bug magnet and so I am proud to say that I only managed to softlock the game once and they patched it out!

Janitor Bleeds Review  Summary I have played and finished Janitor Bleeds! While I think the game might be a little short for some people and still lacks a bit of polish it is overall a very enjoyable experience that is well crafted. Solid recommendation from my side! StoryThe protagonist crashes their car against a rock and finds an abandoned and haunted arcade and must survive the trials within.The story of JANITOR BLEEDS is extremely lightweight and is taking a backseat to the environment. There is some lore sprinkled out within the arcade, the player can find, but lore/story in text form takes a clear backseat to the story telling that takes place within the enviornment. In JANITOR BLEEDS a lot is communicated by the environment and gives you clues what actually happened. It is just enough to make your brain go wild! GameplayThe game is an exploration/walking sim/hide from the monster type of affair and gradually ramps up the threat level until it escalates. My favorite part is that the monster haunting the arcade is not a one hit kill affair and even if it hits you, you still have chance to get away. You also play an Atari-styled arcade machine called Janitor which helps you progressing through the game at certain points. The arcade as an environment gradually opens up and can be explored. It is a short affair but one that never lets up or has any filler content. Which I appreciate more than anything else. There are also secrets in there, so keep an eye out! ConclusionGreat little horror title, if you are not sure then definitively wait for a sale and pick it up then.

For $ 3.33 per title you cannot go wrong. Play the 3 games in the correct order and you will have a gradually increasing difficulty which makes for smoother sailing. You also get to import your party with their experience levels, equipment and spells from the first all the way to the third, literally watching them grow from novice to master.There are some flaws, like the absence of a proper automap which makes navigating the mazes a bit difficult (the trilogy comes with hint books which includes maps and the external \"All-Seeing-Eye\" automapper), or the pretty poor sound effects/music (the games were released 1991 - 1993).Still, the graphics still look pretty darn good today (nice art design), controls are super easy and the monster variety is superb. Happy slaying!"}, {"username": "GRIMM", "comment": "So some are treating this like it is an entirely brand new re-release. The truth is these games have been re-released also previously on GOG a few years back. Same exact games. The ones on Steam are no different in terms of the way they look and play. The one major thing the Steam versions have going for them however which would make a good choice for people who are wondering which versions to get are that the Steam ones are more streamlined in overall presentation. The games on GOG come as separate entries in your library. Things such as manuals, guidebooks, codebooks and other content are all downloaded manually on GOG. Some items even have to be extracted after being downloaded as they download in zip files. And then it would be a little cumbersome to search for the necessary documents when you need them each time. What GOG does have going for it though is that they are 100% DRM free titles. Now where Steam shines as mentioned before is how streamlined they are with these games. You get a unified launcher for the gold box games. any games you own in the series will show up in the launcher. so you could launch say Archives Collection One and play Pool of Radiance instead, or maybe Al Qadim, as long as you own those also. Furthermore, documents, code wheels, and everything are accessible right in the launcher. no need to hunt them down. It's recommended to play in a windowed mode to have access to both the game and the launcher for your necessary resources, but the launcher has you covered with a variety of windowed resolutions to make things look nice. GOG on the flipside would require you you to manually go into dosbox to fiddle with these settings as the basic launch only gives you either fullscreen or a tiny window if you alt tab out. It can still work the way you want, but for those not looking to waste time setting things up and get right into the games, the Steam version has got you covered in the best way."}, {"username": "Neferex", "comment": "Well here we are, back at it again.

It's almost been 10 years and I'm still playing it. Shattered P.D. however is a much better and spruced up version of Pixel Dungeon, and the complex gameplay and new mechanics makes it extraordinarily fun. I've got so many runs played on this game that I'm honestly quite reluctant to say aloud how much time I've spent playing this. Everyone who has been playing P.D. on mobile knows this is a must buy.. To those who are new to Shattered P.D:This is a procedurally generated roguelike that follows one simple objective. You need to go deeper into the dungeon and surpass every foe and boss that stands in your way in order to retrieve a magical artifact known as the Amulet of Yendor.Be prepared to die and do not expect the game to be merciful to new players, because it's not. You are going to die, either swiftly and painlessly, or slowly and painfully. Sometimes your demise will even make you chuckle, you never know... one minute you're out reading scrolls to discover their effects, the next one you realize you've teleported yourself into a pond of piranhas that will eat you alive before you even get to escape ( I wish I wasn't speaking from experience here ).At first, you will feel overwhelmed by the amount of information, items, talents and overall mechanics that the game has to offer.. but that's normal. Play for a while and get to discover new stuff, the more carefully you play, the further you'll get, and the more satisfaction you'll get out of it.I have also taken note of some reviews mentioning how the controls can be iffy, and while I can understand their frustration, I definitely disagree with them. You can easily play this either from your keyboard alone, your mouse alone, or even both at the same time ( It even has partial controller support.. ). It's very malleable, and I am one to appreciate that.. besides, you can just change the keybinds to something else whenever by accessing the menu.Best of luck to you and don't forget to share your first death!"}, {"username": "FrenchToast", "comment": "It's great to have this on PC, blue-stacks just didn't cut it, it's so delightfully compact and lightweight you could run it on virtually anything, i've been playing this for hundreds of hours on mobile for 7 years or so, tossing a few dollars to purchase this gem is way more than worth it if you ask me, honestly, you deserve it, when i saw it announced for steam, it felt like heaven, so give it a try, even just the demo, it saves your progress, provided you survive!P.SI've always found it funny that it's easier to punch a ghost if you surprise it at the door, if i apply this knowledge maybe my past will no longer haunt me."}, {"username": "Woozy", "comment": "Protip: Use the in-game Journal [J] for crafting recipes and general game knowledge"}, {"username": "Mupinstienika", "comment": "Great game!

A lot of pros. Some neutrals: Linear region and boss progression (other content makes up for this), Little to no story (not really needed imo), Very long learning curve (bad for some people, good for me). As a con, needs a better tutorial. Some beginner tips at the bottom. I've been playing this game for over 5 years and it became my favourite Android game by far. Was very thrilled to see it finally come out on Steam. Although it looks like it is not that big of a game compared to many well-known roguelike releases, I genuenly think that it can stand on its' own easily as a desktop game with the sheer amount of content it has.Has a lot of pros, few neutrals and one spesific, although important con. I tried to talk about the main aspects and did not get into details. I also wrote a few tips for beginners at the bottom. Pros: - A lot of interesting content compared to its' size. Randomized stages and items each run;4 characters that all play mostly differently; Many, many different weapons, artifacts, rings, potions, scrolls, wands, seeds, enchantments, curses, traps, general useful tools and items; Alchemy system, character spesific skill system, special challenge system;5 different regions with 5 different bosses that are completely different;Secrets, quests, shops, challenge rooms, treasure rooms, few allies, many enemies, rare enemies;- Banger music.- Rat King Neutral: - Little to no \"story\" and lore. I don't really care about this, as I don't think that the game really intends to have much of a story in the first place. If you're looking for story, you're in the wrong place.- Progression is linear. You will always go through the same 5 regions in the same order, seeing mostly the same enemies, slaying the same 5 bosses every time. This is in neutral because I think the sheer amount of stuff you can get and the randomized stages in the game easily makes up for this.That and two spesific challenges also do a good job at spicing up the enemies and bosses, but those don't unlock until you beat the game normally.- VERY long but equally rewarding learning curve. You will go from constantly dying in the first few stages to pretty much winning every single game unless you get EXTREMELY unlucky, IF you give it a long time. This is in neutral because I know this can be a con for some people, although it is mostly a pro for me. Soooo... I put it in the middle. Cons: - Needs a better tutorial. Although the current tutorial is not all that bad, I do think that it can be improved drastically. Maybe a small pre-built tutorial stage that gives you a few examples of the different, very basic applications? Examples of combat, locked rooms, searching, traps, upgrades...Overall, I do think this is a very good game and you can very well buy it full-price too as it easily gives its' money's worth. Few tips for beginners: - Use your examine tool a lot when you first start. Right click on an unusual looking tile and select examine (or press e then select the tile). This will usually give you useful information.- Read the tooltip for the first few items you get. Learn what an item with purple, blue or red tinted background means. Also learn which items you can or can't use.- Read the \"Tome of Dungeon Mastery\" that is given at the beginning and whenever you get a new page. An example of useful info you can get from the tome: Fight enemies one by one. Lure them into a corridor.- In short... Read. It is not a very long read, doing the first three will probably take about 5 minutes total but will improve your chances a lot if you start applying what you have learned.- Good luck!"}, {"username": "Lord Gek", "comment": "A guy took the public domain source code of Pixel Dungeon and turned it up to 11!"}, {"username": "Eonfge", "comment": "This game is 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ free.

In it, you progress through the dungeon which has multiple floors and rooms within it, collecting loot and fighting off enemies in turned based combat and action. The gameplay is quite simple with your character having weapons to fight against enemies and using the type of weapon depending on the character class and subclass that you use. There are multiple heroes, subclasses, abilities and talent to go through which makes subsequent runs feel unique. This is reinforced with the procedurally generated runs that you go through. The various elements within the game are also a factor, including certain enemies being better at dodging so you are required to hide in the bushed for sneakier attacks. With the vast number of enemies and items to use and craft, it feels fresh with every run.For those that enjoy pixel art graphics, as it is in the name, Pixel Dungeon has appealing pixel art. From the use of colour to design what is within the dungeons to the designs of the characters, enemies and environment, the game looks wonderful. It is a bit hard to explain, but the complete black background besides the dungeon itself adds this element of dungeon crawling to the game. Accompanying the engaging visuals, is some adventurous music that really does make it more immersive and refreshing to explore.The control is simple to play with as it is possible to play using only your mouse to navigate the character, fighting enemies as well as managing your items and the menu. The more difficult part would have to be the learning curve. While it is not a high ceiling, the core mechanic at times needs to be more understood.It is free on mobile available on both Android and Iphone, however, is a paid game on Steam. Though it does look and feels a lot nicer playing on a bigger screen. The additional features such as steam achievements, ease of playing, and the low price point, makes it worth the purchase. Overall, it is a very fun dungeon crawler and roguelike in the traditional sense. It is well presented and enjoyable to play.

This is the distillation of the factorio, the satisfactory and the dyson sphere dopamine drips, embedded in the lore of Master of Magic. I am not sure whether by accident or by design, but the designer of this game stumbled (devised) THE best, abstract, resource/production chain management game up to now. Read on if you need the rationale. The game is not an idler. I bought it on version 0.5.x so I don't know how it was before. But it is not an idler because you can't play it without thinking. There are intertwined systems within systems of production, resources and upgrades, distilled out of spatial trappings (where to put factories-where to store the stuff) and you need to have your mind there if you want to meanigfully progress. The game has such a great emergent lore \"flavour\" that it really puts you in the shoes of a disembodied sorcerer who is again coming to the world and shaping it. In fact this game reminded me already of the diverse spellcasting of Master of Magic. If the developer adds (or has already?

If they classified, correctly, their game as resource production, management game they could legitimately charge 10-12  euros for it. The fact that you have numbers going up is irrelevant. Numbers go up also in the storage containers of Satisfactory. This is simply, the best distilled, resource and production chain management game in steam now.

For under five dollars, easily worth it!When building, you choose 1 of 3 random towers, each attached to 3 track segments in familiar \"tetris\" shapes. The random pool can be improved by investing, and you have recipes to \"refactor\" 3 towers together into a stronger one.This means each build, you're picking based on tower type, tower level, the track shape, what tower fusions are available right now, among other things. Plus the expected TD gameplay of looking at the upcoming wave and considering if your defense can hold it, or whether you can afford to save instead.This is all introduced to you piece-by-piece through the difficulty levels, giving a very effective tutorial where you're always playing around with something new.\"Refactored\" turrets have a passive based on which three tower types were used. You can stack up to 3 (*or 4) of these passives on a single tower, if you like, allowing for miniature roguelite \"builds\" across your defense. This adds even further to the strategic decision-making.None of this is overwhelming, however. Placing towers is simple, since the only restriction is one tower per square. While you have to have a valid path at all times, you can buy individual path squares whenever you like, to bridge little gaps.As for criticism:The game feels a little bit early, and even the developer considers it \"~v0.5\" right now - in particular, the English translation is a bit spotty. Everything that *is* there seems solid, though, and I have faith that the developer will resolve these sorts of things.Overall: Falls into the \"cool little game\" category - worth the price for the fun, and worth checking out even for tower defense veterans."}, {"username": "no_name_", "comment": "A solid, challenging and entertaining tower defense game.

The scenario itself is actually extremely difficult (I restarted ~20 times before winning stage 5), especially if you are not an expert at tower defense. It would be better if the developer can collect some statistics about the usages of each refactored tower, and buff some weak towers.

So I was able to try all of the games. Let me talk about themShapes Honestly I'm not sure if this one is even part of the scoring as if you skip the introduction it doesn't make you go through it. (May require another player) but this one is (at-least in it's current state) near impossible to do, as if you're the contestant then you can't even fit the small blocks in due to an invisible wall or poor collision and if you're the audience then the bigger blocks are unstable when picking them up. I've been told that this isn't part of the actual game and is a gag, so that explains it :P The jigsaw puzzle This one this fairly straight forward and is fine, but gets boring when you've played it multiple times in a row. Memory test This one is also straight forward and gets more difficult as it goes on, I'm not sure if the patterns change each time or if you could just simply take photos and just breeze through it each round after round. Pattern test Some of the patterns are straight forward and others are not, I blame this probably on me having brain damage or something. Conclusion Right now in it's state, it's 50/50 on whether or not you'll successfully play a round and not get frozen controls, but even after that, the game will get repetitive quickly so unless they're planning adding on more content to it in the future, I don't think bug fixes will be enough to save this game's future.Don't get me wrong, I understand the effort put in and speaking as a software engineer myself, this is the kinda thing that just ruins your day when you put hard work and effort into something and then it goes live in production and just breaks. It's not a good feeling and I truly feel bad for the developers, hell it also highlights that sometimes QA isn't 100% perfect, people make mistakes and miss things.Once they fix the bugs then the game will be worth a try, but as I said it's going to need more content to help keep it afloat and fresh."}, {"username": "wormwood", "comment": "\"Are you smarter than the crowd\" is a party game in the same vein as something like a Jackbox Party Pack game, but of course, much different. It's just came out, and while a majority of the reviews currently base their scores off of technical issues, I'd like to approach this from an alternate point of view, while still addressing those later on.A major reason one might have in this game would have to be because of the creator's renown for his previous work made through Source Filmmaker and Blender, with his unique and blunt presentation. Through the game's ever-prevalent, \"Host\", TipsyDuck's style and humor still has that same charm seen in his earlier work through these, strange pseudo human / egg people. Speaking of, this game does provide a good amount of customization for them: giving a wide variety of colors and name-tags to give your contestant/audience member. Additionally, the scenery around the sound-stage is visually nice to look at, and moving around the area has couple of funny details that add to the overall world-building.While clearly not in a finished state, this game absolutely has potential. The main idea of the game is that you (if chosen as Contestant), are to face 9 other (max) players in a series of three, fairly simply puzzles. The challenge starts with a Jigsaw puzzle, a Memorization puzzle, and a \"Pattern Recognition\" puzzle, all designed to progressively increase your IQ score, with the goal of seeing who reaches the highest total. The first two puzzles are simple enough to do, though had trouble with the pattern recognition section, as after the first half of the puzzles the symbols began to look unique and I couldn't discern what was a pattern and what wasn't.Overall, going through a round of the game is pretty entertaining, and with a group of friends going in first-hand, I imagine could result in some pretty fun times. At this stage, there aren't many players, so a good portion of the entertainment that would come from this is going to be lost right now. However, I had still found value in playing the rounds over again to both try my hand at getting a better score, as well as see one of the different endings depending on whoever achieves the highest amount. For those who are more globally competitive, there is additionally an \"I.Q.\" Map that totals the average IQ for each country in the world that lists the smartest country by rank. It's a neat system, and it certainly adds a sense of replay-ability to beat other countries.As for some constructive criticism design-wise, I think this game could benefit greatly from a large number of randomized voice-lines for the Host. With him having new things to say every moment the replay-ability could be substantially better, as I found myself playing multiple times to reach those unique endings, but hearing the Host say the exact same things each time was disappointing. And of course, the obvious bugs and technical issues that are currently in this version.While I may not recommend you buy this right now, I would recommend keeping an eye on it if it's presentation is interesting to you.

Don't overestimate your expectations, it's just a good adventure with unusual visuals and simple puzzles. Of course, the main charm here is the cats. There are many of them, they are the most diverse and meowing, they do crazy things, and it is simply impossible not to love them. And if you also consider that their charm is combined with a frightening environment, then the cocktail from this turns out to be very unusual. I am glad that the artists here have worked hard on the diversity of the design of locations, they really differ from each other, helping the player to feel like in a real museum of environments of various expositions. Puzzles are organically intertwined with the environment, the solution to each can be easily found if you strain your brains properly. The gameplay, traditional for the genre, is diluted several times with stealth episodes, which is also unlikely to cause any special difficulties.

I really have only one problem with the game, and it's that you have to hold down the mouse to move, but aside from that, it's a very enjoyable story with nice visuals. I would say 90 minutes of content with a few optional achievements, just about every location has a unique design with interesting characters,  very creative and friendly puzzles, and surprisingly decent narrative, I even dropped a few tears at the end - I felt the game's ending lasted for like 30 minutes, which is nice for that closure, I thought they transitioned from dark metaphors into the hopeful conclusion very well. It's a point&click with almost no backtracking, granted 40% of the game consists of interactive puzzles, not so much picking things up. I have to say I really enjoyed the puzzle design, the game has a good balance when making psychedelic puzzles that are not too difficult, I think the hardest puzzle took me 1 minute. I guess I should mention the game is somewhat linear, you do get to explore a little when traveling between the floors, but for the most part, the exploration is very limited - which is not necessarily a bad thing, I think the game does a good job avoiding any confusing objectives. I am usually not a fan of interactive puzzles where you have to combine or move something on the screen, but in this game, these elements didn't feel clunky or too difficult.There are some monster encounters where you have to hide but don't worry about those, they are not difficult or frequent, I didn't even die once (I think I counted like 3 escapes in total). Pros: (+) I was following the story from start to finish, I think you did a really good job with the closure, and I appreciate all of the context when meeting again with the characters. (+) Every location had something interesting to offer in terms of visuals, not a lot of backtracking so you constantly get something new. Some interesting characters, both in terms of visual design and dialogue. (+) To me easy puzzles is not a con, I think you found a good balance between making something creative, and easy to follow. Most of the hints were very intuitive, the only one I missed was the puppet puzzle which I solved by accident. (+) Some achievement support with optional tasks.  Feedback: Mostly nitpicks that I don't care to mention. The only small thing, you should aim for the 1-click movement instead of holding down the button, if not for this game, maybe for the next. Kinda wish you had maybe a few load points, just to get the achievements. If you don't have save slots, you can always make some unlockable chapters you know, I imagine it's a bit easier to implement.  Overall Thoughts: 8/10 It's very rare for me to buy a cheap game on release and to get something above average, but it feels like you put a lot of effort into this world. Started a little slow for me, but you know what, you really took it home all the way, really good closure. Awesome visuals, nice puzzles, interesting characters - had fun from start to finish.

However, the artwork in Cat Museum intrigued me and it was on sale. Plus, I had enjoyed playing Life Gallery - an earlier game by the same developers. After completing this game, all I can say is 'Wow!'At face value, it is the story of a boy and a cat exploring a bizarre museum. With art in the macabre style of a Forgotten Hill game (but with vibrant colors) and an original sound track, this game is a delight to play. The puzzles are simple but several require some perfectly timed precision clicking. There are no voice overs and there is a minimal amount of text to read when clicking on items marked for examination. Not all actionable hot spots are marked so there is a bit of clicking around to figure out how to move forward when no exits are visible.The game uses only the mouse (click and hold to move the character, click to drag/drop inventory, and double click to interact). There are no instructions on the controls and it took me a few minutes to figure out how to play.  The game automatically saves to a single slot and there is no way to redo a puzzle or retrace your steps for a missed achievement. As a result, achievement hunters are likely to find themselves needing to play through more than once.As you are puzzling your way through the most interesting of museums, a narrative begins to unfold. To avoid spoilers, I will only say that it broke my heart towards the end. What starts out as eye candy with puzzles turns into a deeply moving, multi-layered experience.This is a short (can be completed in under 3 hours) and sweet adventure that cat lovers and any gamer with a heart should not miss.

And your main goal is to survive to 10 minutes or beat certain bosses depending on the arena. And as you destroy enemies they drop experience that allows you to choose a card to level up your ship. And there's a huge variety of different cards from things that allow your ship to shoot more bullets, or ones that allow you to start firing torpedoes and more.And each upgrade can also be leveled up around 3-5 times depending on the upgrade. And there are also insane synergies you can get like if you max our the multishot card and the scythe card and you break open a red gem that can drop from certain enemies you can combine them into a crazy synergy that gives you two scythes.And you eventually unlock ultra synergies that allow you to combine two different synergies into an even crazier synergy. So I’ve gotten an ultra synergy before that turns my entire ship into a beast that is shooting giant green lasers at my enemies that was instakilling everyone.And the longer you survive in the arenas the more and more insane they get. They will start to throw literally hundreds and hundreds of enemies and it’s just so freaking satisfying to mow them down and see these little bright blue pixels of xp float to your ship and level you up and make you stronger and stronger. And although you “win” arenas at 10 minutes or by defeating bosses you can still just try to survive as long as you can and get a high score. And as you play the game you constantly level up an out of game progression system that unlocks more cards to find in the game, new ships to try out, new synergies and ultra synergies, new arenas and more. And you will also be able to unlock and level up different perks that you can attach to any ship by collecting different colored gems like the red gems I talked about earlier during runs. So you can tailor and customize any ship to your liking. So as an example I always put the lifesteal perk on all my ships because I love constantly healing back to full after I take some damage.And it’s hard to ignore how freaking good this game looks. The game has a super gorgeous neon light art style and all the different arenas are themed in different ways and colors and seeing thousands of orbs of xp spill out of enemies is just so freaking satisfying. The game also has an incredible soundtrack that matches perfectly with the gameplay and visuals.And even though the game is only $4 it has so much content and replayability and it’s still getting even more updates. The game is already incredible but after it gets a couple more updates it’s gonna be one of the best roguelites that have come out recently.

My main problem is that every game that is successful will end up with all the same upgrades.

The game does a very good job at building anxiety due to the fact that most entity encounters are far and few between (at least at the start), and everything is procedurally generated so that no two games are the same, and you won't expect what you'll run into next. I also believe this game is a step up from the other walking-simulator Backrooms games due to the hunger, thirst and sanity mechanics, which you have to juggle along with dodging monsters or even occasionally fighting them, if you're lucky enough to find a weapon.On the flip side, some things I think the game should improve on; streamer class definitely feels a bit more significant than the other classes due to the fact I found a weapon about 99% of the time with it, while with other classes I'd be lucky enough to even find enough food and water on the ground. Some of the sound effects and screams also feel repeated on some entities, even on different floors, so that also took some immersion away. Finally, if you have the VHS and PS1-effects graphics on, on some floors, it is VERY difficult to see items on the floor (and on that note, it's also sometimes difficult just to pick up those items themselves!)Despite these shortcomings, the game is in early access, so I believe the developer is on the good path to making a great game right now. He just made a Discord server and is actively listening to all feedback, so I've got high hopes for this project which already has a lot of groundwork and content set for it."}, {"username": "StaticArcadeTTV", "comment": "Let me just say-I don't do horror games. And this game is the reason why. I am not the person who enjoys jumpscares and running, screaming, from disgusting monsters and fiends wanting to use my blood as tomato sauce. If this sounds like your jam though, you're gonna love this. The lore of the Backrooms creepy pasta receives an incredible addition with the release of this game."}, {"username": "Shia", "comment": "I was, and still am, very excited about the concept of this game. I think the developers have the right idea in mind for making a \"backrooms\" game in that is it RANDOM. HOWEVER, I would not recommend this game or even consider playing more than the 50 minutes that I already have in it's current state due to one issue. Don't get me wrong, I am UPSET that I'm unable to play more- as I WANT TO SO BADLY. The one thing I cannot get over in ANY horror related content are jumpscares that take the \"cheap\" (screamer) way out and are UNAVOIDABLE. I think that jumpscares are GREAT and have the potential to be good moments, but not when they're unavoidable,  unreasonably loud, and last longer than they should- which gives them the impression they're out to destroy my hearing more than give me a quick scare. I hope that in future development of this game, the audio and \"jump scares\" can be more reasonably modified for better playing experiences so that I can play this game again with FEAR OF MONSTERS- not FEAR of losing my hearing. Looking forward to seeing where the development of this game goes!"}, {"username": "𝒑𝒔𝒚𝒅𝒆𝒙", "comment": "I sh@t my pants. TWICE!https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1451679170"}, {"username": "argeary1314", "comment": "This is phenomenal. This game has insane potential to turn into a LEGENDARY horror game, one of the best horror games of ALL TIME, like SCP Containment Breach. The game is in a surprisingly good state for being just released. I only have a few friendly recommendations for this amazing game:1. Give the Entities sound when they're moving, not just audio cues. The ones that walk, give them different footstep sounds. The ones that crawl, shuffling sounds. The one that floats? Not making movement sound should be exclusive to it, making that particular entity more terrifying. 2. Make getting \"hit\" more noticeable. When I am getting hit by an enemy, for example, cut with a chainsaw, there should be a stronger reaction from the character. I recommend just a minor screen \"jolt\", and some kind of audio cue such as the character shouting, or flesh tearing.3. Food, Drink: You did REALLY well on the rate that hunger, thirst, and sanity decrease. However, the amount that food and drink items refill these meters should be tweaked. I recommend making food and drink much less common, but whenever you consume one, it should refill much more of the meter. Think realistically: One apple should refill maybe 30% of the hunger meter, and 20% of the thirst meter. Apples hydrate, not just feed. Bananas are POWERFUL and underrated as far as nutrition goes. They should refill 40-50% of the hunger meter. Then, you could have other rare food items like full-blown meals that refill much of both. Keep the rate of decrease for these meters the same, but make food rarer and more rewarding.4. Sanity: I'm unsure about this one. I see that it correlates to certain on-screen jump scares, and audio/visual prompts. I would recommend one of two options for Sanity:Option one: Sanity should refill when you avoid entity encounters for long enough, find helpful items, etc. Additionally, make sanity actually scary from a game play mechanics perspective, not adding jumpscares. The pipes bursting and stuff falling from the ceiling is PLENTY enough of jumpscares. To make sanity scary from a gameplay point of view, I think if it drops to 0%, something crazy happens, such as an extremely deadly entity spawns in that level. If the player escapes that level, sanity jumps back up to 10% and the \"Sanity Demon\" is no longer chasing the player.Option Two: Don't have a sanity meter. This game really doesn't need one, as ambience and entities and graphics alone make the game perfect. Sanity technically depends upon the real life person playing this game. Makes sense that as they play it more, they get a better grip on their \"sanity\" while playing it."}, {"username": "Ha†ecraf†", "comment": "I am a huge fan of The Backrooms lore so I had to give this a try.

You control a small milk bottle with the arrows keys that constantly shoots out milk droplets. Your goal is to hit the targets on the screen to slowly remove the clothes from each Monster Girl. Each level will also have 5 flying enemies that will cause an instant game over if you touch them. Once all targets are broken the milk bottle will begin to spray uncontrollably across the screen leaving the poor monster girl soaked in milk, that definitely does not look like anything else.Despite the gameplay being basically the same, I will say the art is a massive step up from the previous game. Not that the art was bad or anything in the first, but there is a very noticeable improvement in quality here. all the art is fantastic and is easily worth the games low asking price.Overall, it's a pretty fun and decently solid arcade game for those who don't mind a game that will only take them 30 minutes to complete. The real appeal here is mostly the art though and it definitely delivers.If you'd like to see a closer look at what the game has to offer I have a short video review over on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkckWRokDg4bP6lpkqC6fFA/videos"}, {"username": "ZURC", "comment": "Just like the 1st game the game play is fun (though it seems waaaayyy easier) it has good fan service and artwork, but unlike the 1st game it has less achievements."}, {"username": "Ferx", "comment": "⢸⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⡷⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⡇⠢⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠈⠑⢦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Are you wasting my money⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠖⠒⠒⠒⢤⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢦⡀⠀⠀   on hentai games again son?⢸⠀⠀⣀⢤⣼⣀⡠⠤⠤⠼⠤⡄⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠀⠀⠑⡤⠤⡒⠒⠒⡊⠙⡏⠀⢀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⠢⡄⠀⢸⠀⠀⠀⠇⠀⣀⣀⣀⣀⢀⠧⠟⠁⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⢸⠀⠀⠀⠸⣀⠀⠀⠈⢉⠟⠓⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢱⡖⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⢺⠧⢄⣀⠀⠀⣀⣀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⠀⣠⠃⢸⠀⠀⠈⠉⡽⠿⠯⡆⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⣰⠁⠀⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠉⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⠣⠀⠀⢸⢄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠀⢇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡌⠀⠈⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⠃⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠀⠀⠀⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠷"}, {"username": "𝕯𝖗𝖞❆𝕴𝖈𝖊", "comment": "All you have to do in the game is to dodge and shoot and take out all the targets is the victory.

I'm writing this because I like some elements and hope the creator will reconsider some of the issues in future work.Basically I feel like the game's problem is that too many of your choices don't matter. My first run I was choosing randomly and didn't get a single ascension but I got close to wave 50 and felt good. My second run I read up on how ascensions work and picked more strategically... and died a little before wave 50. I tried an entirely different strategy someone mentioned on the forums and again died around wave 50. I ignored all strategies and just went for damage: again I got to around wave 50.Even when I made bad choices my game ended up about the same. The first levels are relatively easy but eventually enemy health ramps up in the 40s and 50s and you get overwhelmed. There's nothing you can do at this point and you've probably spent 15-30 minutes getting that far.There are rogue-lite elements but they're mostly unimportant. It takes multiple games to earn one upgrade and even when you have them all it doesn't make a meaningful difference to your strength. Some of the alternate equipment is interesting but the game should really tell you that most of the staffs with interesting effects only deal half damage. Sucks to spend all your points on the homing staff only to find that it's basically useless in a game where enemies fill the screen.There ARE combos that seem able to stay ahead of the enemy curve. But they're relatively few and they're not necessarily very fun. More importantly the likely average gameplay isn't that fun. Most of the time your damage builds can't keep up, your defense builds get one-shot out of nowhere, and going all in on something different is unrewarding. Choosing from all kinds of ability cards is a fun mechanic but the more I understood the game the less fun it was."}, {"username": "Tchey", "comment": "I love the visual and the idea, but no.It will be a Yes if the grind is lowered by a lot.To get any basic update you need 25 points, and you get 1-3 per run at first when you are weak and bad.So you must replay a lot before playing again a lot with different stuff.The powerballing feel is not there.Plus, no key rebinding, must play with Arrows to move + Space to jump + Mouse to target.Only good is you have an auto fire toggle.Oh also, no particule reduction option."}, {"username": "Vo0 is a Sleepy Panda", "comment": "Dopamine Dispenser"}, {"username": "lewisflude", "comment": "Great little roguelike game, with a fun deck building mechanic, bullet hell elements and insane synergies.
